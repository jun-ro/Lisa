Kazuya Kinoshita,Hey! How are you?
Chizuru Ichinose,I'm doing good, what about you?
Chizuru Ichinose,An orange shirt and striped pants…
Chizuru Ichinose,"You must be Kazuya-Kun, right?"
Chizuru Ichinose,You’re in college? What year?
Kazuya Kinoshita,F-First year.
Chizuru Ichinose,"What? Me, too!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, but I took a gap year."
Chizuru Ichinose,"Ah, you are older than me then."
Chizuru Ichinose,Oops.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Damn…
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s hot!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Anyone dating her would be living the life!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Whoa.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, uh…"
Chizuru Ichinose,Do you mind?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, sure. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Crap… I wanna leave.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I wanna go home and sleep.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, so we’re following the date plan I sent by text."
Chizuru Ichinose,This is my first time at an aquarium.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Really? That’s unusual.
Chizuru Ichinose,Look that fish is cute.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh that’s the lowlight tetra. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Do you know a lot about fish?
Kazuya Kinoshita,I-I guess? I love hitting up aquariums.
Chizuru Ichinose,Wow!
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m so glad my first aquarium visit was with you!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Well, I had lots of fun today."
Chizuru Ichinose,"Thanks, Kazuya-kun! See you! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,O-Outrageous!
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was all an act!?
Kazuya Kinoshita,Holding hand before the end is just part of her routine?!
Kazuya Kinoshita,How dare she toy with my heart?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I just need to give her a piece of my mind! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Kazuya-Kun, did you wait long?"
Chizuru Ichinose,I was worried you might not like this hairdo.
Chizuru Ichinose,What do you think?
Kazuya Kinoshita,I-I don’t hate it or anything.
Chizuru Ichinose,Thank goodness!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Damn it! She’s so cute!
Chizuru Ichinose,Fee received. Thank you.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, doesn’t it make you feel empty inside?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y’know, going on dates with guys you don’t even like."
Kazuya Kinoshita,And getting paid for it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Doesn’t it get to you? 
Chizuru Ichinose,No. I love my job. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"I get to meet people like you, after all."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? W-We’re not ma- 
Chizuru Ichinose,We’re dating.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"No, we’re not even that."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"We're total strangers, aren't we? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Technically.
Cashier,"Oh, uh… I guess I’ll split your purchases up."
Chizuru Ichinose,"Sure. We can be whatever you wants us to be, Kazuya-kun."
Chizuru Ichinose,"Look, Kazuya- kun! Neon tetras! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, yeah."
Chizuru Ichinose,Cute! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Garden eels hide in the sand because they’re afraid, right?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wow… she must have read up on them.
Kazuya Kinoshita,She did her homework… all for today’s date.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Enough already.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Seriously, what is that gonna achieve?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Is that just your professionalism? It’s meaningless! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Not like these relationships last more than a day!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, what’s gotten into you, Kazuya-kun?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,You must break up immediately!
Kazuya Kinoshita,It doesn’t matter how much you care for your partner!
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s get out of here. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I know that was stupid…
Kazuya Kinoshita,But I got it off of my chest…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why do all these girls get into fake relationships with people they don’t even like?!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Okay, look…"
Chizuru Ichinose,What is wrong with you? Are you stupid?!
Chizuru Ichinose,Yelling like that in a public place… Way to get everyone’s eyes on us.
Chizuru Ichinose,"What’s your problem, anyway?"
Chizuru Ichinose,"All day you’ve been like, “Don’t you feel empty inside?” And “We’re total strangers!”"
Chizuru Ichinose,Seriously are you stupid? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,U-Uh…
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m your rental girlfriend. This is just how it works! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Weren’t you the one who made the request?!
Chizuru Ichinose,"You saw the user agreement and clicked “I agree”, didn’t you?!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I did… I’m sorry.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Also, why did you give me a one-star review?! "
Chizuru Ichinose,Did I do anything wrong on our date?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"That brought my rating down a whole 0.3 points, you know!"
Chizuru Ichinose,I’d only ever gotten five-star reviews before that.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Here we go.
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is the real Mizuhara Chizuru.
Chizuru Ichinose,"I’ve always given this job my all, including this date. "
Chizuru Ichinose,I don’t even like fish but I went and bought a book about them for this date.
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s a completely different person than before.
Kazuya Kinoshita,All I can say for sure is…
Chizuru Ichinose,Could you not get in the way of my work?
Chizuru Ichinose,I can’t believe you!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Ugh, this sucks! Guess I’m getting another one-star review!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m totally in the wrong.
Chizuru Ichinose,"So, what now?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Do you want to continue?
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ll tag along if you want to keep going.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hello? What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Hey! We’re not done talking here! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? Seriously? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Got it! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,My grandma collapsed…
Chizuru Ichinose ,Huh?
Kazuya Kinoshita,I gotta go! 
Chizuru Ichinose,H-Hey! 
Chizuru Ichinose,You still have time left! 
Grandma Nagomi,It’s not such a big deal. I only fainted.
s Mother,"But of course we would worry, Mother! Your health is important! "
s Father,"Mom, you need to realise that you aren’t young anymore."
s Father,We do have a shop to run! 
s Father,And this isn’t the first time you’ve been hospitalised.
Grandma Nagomi,Does this room have WI-FI? 
s Mother,The phone is probably a bad idea.
s Father,I’ll get you some magazines for senior citizens! 
s Mother,Would you like something soft to eat?
Grandma Nagomi,Don’t act like I’m on my last legs! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Anyway, who might that young lady be?"
s Mother,I brought her in because she was with Kazuya.
s Mother,Are you his classmate from college?
Chizuru Ichinose,E-Er…
s Mother,"You couldn’t be his girlfriend, right?"
s Father,"No way, honey. This is Kazuya we’re talking about. "
s Mother,Right. It’s Kazuya. 
Grandma Nagomi,Kazuya? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,G-Girlfriend…
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s my girlfriend! 
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s a pleasure to meet you.
Chizuru Ichinose,My name is Mizuhara Chizuru. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Perfect.
Chizuru Ichinose,"It’s a shame I had to introduce myself under such circumstances, but I’m glad to meet you all nonetheless. "
Grandma Nagomi,Get me discharged! 
s Father,What?!
Grandma Nagomi,We need to get home and prepare for a party!
s Father,"Don’t be absurd, Mom! "
Grandma Nagomi,Listen to yourself!
Grandma Nagomi,Kazuya”s brought home a real hale and hearty hottie!
Chizuru Ichinose,H-Hale and hearty hottie?! 
Grandma Nagomi,Can you believe it? Our Kazuya…
s Father,Mom!
Grandma Nagomi,He has such as beautiful girlfriend! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Grandma Nagomi,"Our Kazuya, of all people! "
Grandma Nagomi,After showing no signs of anything resembling a love life for twenty whole years. 
Grandma Nagomi,Kazuya… Our Kazuya has…
s Father,"We’re heading back to the store. Watch over her, Kazuya."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sure.
s Father,"And make sure you walk your girlfriend back, okay? "
s Mother,"Chizuru-san, come visit our home sometime."
Chizuru Ichinose,Thank you.
Grandma Nagomi,"By the way, you two…"
Grandma Nagomi,Have you had sex already?
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gran! 
Grandma Nagomi,Physical compatibility matters a lot in a marriage.
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Marriage? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Kazuya-san and I have talked about it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,We both want to take the things seriously. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"He’s your family’s eldest son, so we wanted to hold off until we had your approval. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Her ad libbing is on point! 
Grandma Nagomi,Do it! You have my permission! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Day or night, whenever! As much as you want! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gran! 
Chizuru Ichinose,If you say so…
Chizuru Ichinose,I guess we could. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is an act! It’s all an act!
Grandma Nagomi,Oh right! Let me go get the other old girls!
Chizuru Ichinose,Others? 
Grandma Nagomi,They asked me to introduce my grandson’s girlfriend if he ever got one! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, what’s going on here?"
Grandma Nagomi,"Oh, this is the third time she’s been hospitalised here. It seems she’s made quite a few friends here. "
Chizuru Ichinose,What do I do? This is bad!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why are you panicking? 
Chizuru Ichinose,She’s here…
Chizuru Ichinose,My grandma’s an in patient at this hospital too.
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I haven’t told her anything about the rental girlfriend job.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Isn’t that really bad news?
Chizuru Ichinose,That’s exactly what I said!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Anyway, I need to get out of here! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hey… 
Grandma Nagomi,"Follow me, everyone. "
Grandma Nagomi,"She’s a real babe, I tell you !"
Grandma Nagomi,I’ve never seen a girl that hot! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Crap! They're here! 
Chizuru Ichinose,This way! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Try not to collapse in shock, Tanaka-san."
san,I’ll be just fine!
san,"The rest of you watch out for heart attacks, too! "
Grandma Nagomi,Huh? They’re gone.
Kazuya Kinoshita,A vacant room? 
Grandma Nagomi,They were here just a minute ago! 
Grandma Nagomi,It’s true! Believe me! 
Chizuru Ichinose,it’s only a matter of time before they find us here. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wanna exit through the window?
Chizuru Ichinose,We’re on the fifth floor you know. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What do we do then? 
Chizuru Ichinose,We’ll have to leave one at a time. 
Chizuru Ichinose,You go first and distract them. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ll use that chance to get outside. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Distract them? How? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Figure that out yourself! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Th-They’re coming!
Chizuru Ichinose,Get over here! 
Grandma Nagomi,Not here either? 
Grandma Nagomi,"Where art thou, Chizuru? "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Keep it down, stupid! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is…
Kazuya Kinoshita,The biggest crisis of all! 
Chizuru Ichinose,What in the world is wrong with you?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nothing! It’s not my fault! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s a natural response for any twenty year old guy! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Get it back down right now! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I can’t, okay? I just can’t! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"If you keep it up, I’ll report you to the agency. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Don’t move! You’re making its worse! 
Grandma Nagomi,Uh.. are you all right? 
Chizuru Ichinose ,"I am fine, thanks! "
Grandma Nagomi,That’s good. 
Grandma Nagomi,"If I may ask, have you seen a young couple around? "
Grandma Nagomi,Really? Thank you! 
Grandma Nagomi,The targets are outside! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Looks like she’s gone.
Chizuru Ichinose,Yeah…
Kazuya Kinoshita,This range is l-lethal…
Kazuya Kinoshita,What a slender…
Kazuya Kinoshita,And soft… body!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, right now…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She’s my girlfriend, isn’t she? "
Chizuru Ichinose,Like hell!
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you thinking? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t forget that I’m just a rental girlfriend!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hell could freeze over, and I still would be yours for real! "
Grandma Sayuri,"Chizuru? Is that you, Chizuru?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Grandma…
Grandma Nagomi,"What’s the matter, Ichinose-san?"
Grandma Nagomi,Kazuya!
Grandma Sayuri,What's this Kazuya-Kun? 
Grandma Sayuri,You mean your grandson’s girlfriend is Chizuru? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Are you serious?!
Grandma Sayuri,Chizuru is my granddaughter.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I shouldn't make this worse for her! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry, Gran! I don’t really have a girl- "
Chizuru Ichinose,What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Kazuya- san’s grandmother and mine are friends? 
Chizuru Ichinose,What a coincidence! Like it was written in the stars!
Chizuru Ichinose,Or something…
Grandma Nagomi,I don’t believe it.
Grandma Nagomi,"To think Chizuru was your granddaughter, Ichinose-san! "
Grandma Sayuri,"I don’t believe it, either."
Grandma Nagomi,But it all makes sense now.
Grandma Nagomi,Of course your granddaughter would be a bombshell in every possible way!
Grandma Sayuri,"Oh, please."
Grandma Sayuri,"I can also rest easy if Chizuru is dating your grandson, Kinoshita-san."
Grandma Nagomi,Here’s hoping we go from friends to family when they get married. 
Grandma Sayuri,Likewise. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Say no to collusion! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry… I made you lie for me.
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s fine.
Chizuru Ichinose,Lots of clients want to introduce me to their family. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Really?
Chizuru Ichinose,"Anyway, it’s partly my fault for keeping this job a secret. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s just tell them we broke up.
Chizuru Ichinose,That’s the best option.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeah. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,My family runs a store called “Nagomi Sake.” 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was started in my granddad’s time and now my mum and dad run it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Even after my granddad died early.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"My grandma keeps it running, despite having debts and my dad to worry about. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"So, to our family, my grandma’s like a goddess. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And it’s our goddess’s wish that I find someone nice before she dies. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m a real grandma’s boy, so I want ti grant her wish before she goes."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I had a girlfriend for a month, recently."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"When I asked her to meet my grandma, she refused. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And ultimately she dumped me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was out of desperation that I pressed that button and rented you.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Lame as hell, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"What am I, a rabbit?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,One that dies if it gets lonely.
Chizuru Ichinose,There’s no one alive who doesn't get lonely. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Just a lot of people good at hiding it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,They all fill the void in their heart with work or significant others. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll apologise to my grandma… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And introduce a real girlfriend to her someday. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll figure it out myself. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"After all, there’s no way to get your true self on rental. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Ow!
Kazuya Kinoshita,What was that for?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,That was corny as hell! Gross! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Could you please not drag me into your embarrassingly self-absorbed soliloquy? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y-You’re one to talk, with the corny act you put one every day! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, I do it for work. Corny is perfectly fine by me."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, uh… Sorry about everything today."
Kazuya Kinoshita,And thanks.
Chizuru Ichinose,"I’m no different. I want to make my family happy, too."
Chizuru Ichinose,"But, I just can’t quit this job right now. "
Chizuru Ichinose,I don’t want anything like today’s date ever again.
Chizuru Ichinose,But whenever you find yourself feeling like a rabbit. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Feel free to call me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nah. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I doubt I’ll see Mizuhara Chizuru ever again. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I won’t turn to her anymore. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m done with pretend dating forever. 
Chizuru Ichinose,That dork. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And this is where my real story begins.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"The story of my precious, yet optimistic campus life."
kun,"Yo, Kazuchin. "
kun,How many times did you jerk it yesterday? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,The story of my rueful virgin life starts now! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Three times! 
kun,"Whoa, hardcore! "
Kun,Virgins gonna virgin! 
kun,"What’s up, Kazuya? You know her? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? No…
kun,"Who is that, even? "
Kun,I think it’s Ichi… Ichi-something… from the literature department.
kun,So what's the story? Felt like something was up between you two. 
Kun,"Yeah, tell us."
Kazuya Kinoshita,No… I think I mistook her for someone else.
kun,What?!
kun,The heck? Don’t get our hope up like that.
Kun,Any girl you see makes you think you’ve “met her before”? 
Kun,Virgins gonna virgin.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Speak for yourself!
kun,We’ll be in touch later.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sure. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s way too crazy to be true.
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s probably just someone else.
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t you dare tell anyone!
Chizuru Ichinose,You don’t know me at all!
Chizuru Ichinose,And there was nothing between us!
Chizuru Ichinose,Promise me that!
Kazuya Kinoshita,So you really are Mizuhara?
Chizuru Ichinose,"Yes, I am. I’m keeping my job a secret. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Problem with that?
Chizuru Ichinose,I do it because I don’t want people talking behind my back!
Chizuru Ichinose,Repeat after me! You and I are… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Okay, okay! I get it!"
Chizuru Ichinose,Sheesh. Why are you even here?
Chizuru Ichinose,"I’ve been avoiding dates in the same area as the college, but this makes it all meaningless. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Goodbye. I pray that you never hit the “I agree” and “confirm” buttons again.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I can’t believe Mizuhara Chizuru goes to my college…
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh?!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, hang on! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mizuhara-san? It’s you, isn’t it?! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Or wait, Ichinose-san? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Talk about coincidence, huh?"
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you doing here?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, my apartment is next door."
Chizuru Ichinose,"I mean, why do you live here? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Uh, I’m not sure how to answer that."
Chizuru Ichinose,No interacting with me! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"No meddling or prying, either! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,The heck? Don’t act like I’m some kind of stalker.
Kazuya Kinoshita,But…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She’s living in my apartment complex… Right next door, even."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mizuhara Chizuru, of all people."
Grandma Nagomi,"Hey, Kazuya. I finally got through to you."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, you got internet in your hospital room?"
Grandma Nagomi,It’s 980 yen per month for WIFI.
Grandma Nagomi,An unexpected expense!
Kazuya Kinoshita,I need to tell her the truth. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, Gran…"
Grandma Nagomi,"I’m about to head over to your place, Kazuya."
Grandma Nagomi,Can you call Chizuru over for me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? No way! 
Grandma Nagomi,Didn't you know?
Grandma Nagomi,There’s this popular new mobile game called Hot ’n Steamy Hot Springs Matron.
Grandma Nagomi,And this “Sen” girl in it is a dead ringer for Chizuru.
Grandma Nagomi,I ended up whaling for her.
Grandma Nagomi,"See you in a bit, then! I can’t wait! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wait a- 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? Gran’s coming over now? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You need to book a rental girlfriend a week in advance. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s too late now!
Kazuya Kinoshita,But she’ll snap if I tell her in person that we broke up1 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What if she cries on me again? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Help me! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Be my girlfriend one more time! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh? Are you kidding me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Please! Gran’s coming over today! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Just an hour… No, even half an hour will do! "
Chizuru Ichinose,Didn't we agree to tell our grandmas we broke up?
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m not ready for that conversation yet.
Chizuru Ichinose,Why should I care?!
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s taken a real liking to you!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She looked so lively talking about you, I couldn't bring myself to tell her!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Please! I beg of you! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Not happening. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Article 3 (c) of the user agreement: Demanding that our talents accompany the user toothier residence, workplace, or other private space is strictly forbidden.” "
Chizuru Ichinose,"You’re old enough to know what that means, right? "
Chizuru Ichinose,"if you're going to lie, you need to make it right. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Putting things off turns people into children. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"And above all, I decided I’m going to finish my report today. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Goodbye! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Hey, Kazuya. Put on some tea. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,You got here quick! 
Grandma Nagomi,Gotta strike while the iron’s hot. 
Grandma Nagomi,Look at how filthy this apartment is. 
Grandma Nagomi,No one would guess that the guy living here has a girlfriend. 
Grandma Nagomi,She’s sharp as ever.
Grandma Nagomi,When do you think Chizuru will arrive? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, uh, I don't know. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Um… let me try calling her. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hello? It’s me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gran’s already here. You busy?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, you're at work? Ah, I see. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Who is it? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Delivery for you.
Chizuru Ichinose,Hel… Huh?
Kazuya Kinoshita,Please! Just a minute… even ten seconds will do!
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m gonna call the cops! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll buy you sweets from the convenience store! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Get out!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m begging you. Think of it as helping me out! I mean, we’ve date before, right?!"
Chizuru Ichinose,"I was just a rental girlfriend, damn it!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, I have to brace myself and just do it."
Grandma Nagomi,"Hey, Gran…"
Grandma Nagomi,I need to tell you something. 
Grandma Nagomi,"You broke up, didn’t you? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,G-Gran?
Grandma Nagomi,She got tried of sloppiness and split. 
Grandma Nagomi,I can picture it clear as day. 
Grandma Nagomi,And you tried to cover it up because you couldn't bring yourself to tell the truth.
Grandma Nagomi,That is no way for the heir to the Kinoshita family to act. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Aren’t you mad?
Kazuya Kinoshita,At me… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,At Mizuhara? 
Grandma Nagomi,Never in your life have you been a ladies’ man. 
Grandma Nagomi,And I mean that literally! Not even once!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeah.
Grandma Nagomi,All you ever brought over were stinky boys.
Grandma Nagomi,There was a time when I doubted there was a single girl out there who’d come to like you. 
Grandma Nagomi,How could I ever be angry with the lady who did fall for you? 
Grandma Nagomi,She showed me a beautiful dream. 
Grandma Nagomi,Truly an angel sent by the heavens.
Kazuya Kinoshita ,Gran…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, I’m such an idiot. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,A girl like Mizuhara would never date me for real.
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was all an illusion. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s a rental girlfriend.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m sorry, Gran!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I…
Kazuya Kinoshita,I…
Chizuru Ichinose,I-I’m so sorry! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Here we go.
Chizuru Ichinose,I got help up cooking.
Kazuya Kinoshita,How.. Why are you here? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"What are you saying, Kazuya-san? You’ve been calling me all day. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Of course I would go anywhere for your grandmother! 
Grandma Nagomi,My angel! 
Grandma Nagomi,I believed in you! 
Grandma Nagomi,I knew you wouldn't cast Kazuya aside! 
Grandma Nagomi,"A boy like him will never get another girlfriend, after all! "
Grandma Nagomi,You’d better come see me on Wednesday. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I do, every week."
Grandma Nagomi,Not by yourself. Bring Chizuru along. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re not happy just to see me? 
Grandma Nagomi,Absolutely not. 
Grandma Nagomi,"Also, make sure to walk her back. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,You don’t have to tell me. 
Grandma Nagomi,Rest assured. I guarantee that you two will get married someday. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Here. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Never mind that. We’ve gone too far to tell the agency, anyway. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Not for that. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll rent you next week. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But you don't have to come. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"You couldn't get your report done after all this, right? "
Chizuru Ichinose,When do you list her? Wednesday? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Huh? Y-yeah, every Wednesday. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"No other days, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh right! 
Chizuru Ichinose,No meddling! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Make like a stranger at college, too, obviously. "
Chizuru Ichinose,No talking to me! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"if you need to contact me, do it through the site! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mizuhara?
Chizuru Ichinose,Just one hour. 
Chizuru Ichinose ,You can rent me out just for one hour every Wednesday. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m not doing it for you! It’s for your grandmother! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Thanks, Mizuhara! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,For just one hour every Wednesday…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Be my girlfriend!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan…
Kazuya Kinoshita," First period is brand management, huh? "
chan,"Hello, Kazu-kun! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mami-chan…
Kazuya Kinoshita,We haven't talked since we broke up. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Damn, she’s so cute when I see her up close! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Her eyes are so round, and her hair is so fluffy! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Ask her! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Ask her why she blocked you!
chan,"What’s wrong, Kazu-kun? "
chan,You’re spaced out. 
chan,You dropped your reference book.
chan,Here.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Th-Thanks.
chan,Later! 
kun,"That’s him, officer! "
kun,The guy ogling his ex’s thighs first thing in the morning! 
Kun,I get it. Mami chan is fine. 
kun,"She’s feminine as hell, and she’s a total looker."
kun,"To top it off, she seems kinda easy. "
kun,"And she’s sure to go the extra mile in bed, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re the one ogling her! 
kun,"Her, on the other hand? She’ll just lie there and do nothing."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Dude…
kun,"Anyway, let me give you a solid piece of advice as an old bud. "
kun,Forget about Mami-chan.
kun,She’s way out of your league.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Coming, Coming! "
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you doing? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Isn’t it time to head over to the hospital? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s pick somewhere else to meet up. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"If my agency finds out we’re meeting by our front doors, they’ll fire me."
Chizuru Ichinose,We won’t be socialising outside of dates. 
Chizuru Ichinose,But I’ll do my job as usual when I’m your “girlfriend”. 
Chizuru Ichinose,There’s no need to go easy on me in reviews. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gotcha. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Okay, do you mind? "
Chizuru Ichinose,"It’s better for both of us to get the formalities out of the way, yeah? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, yeah. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Thank you very much.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Shall we get going, Kazuya-kun? "
Grandma Nagomi,"Chizuru, my angel! "
Grandma Nagomi,Stop by again! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Can we hold hands? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"What? O-Oh, sure. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s just part of her routine! 
kun,Kazuya? 
kun,What’re you doing here? 
kun,"Oh, right! The hospital Nagomi- san’s in is around here! "
kun,"Wait, who is that? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Crap! They’ll realise it’s Ichinose!
kun,"Sorry! He’s a sheltered idiot, but please don’t sign him up to your cult!"
Kun,"H-He has no money, so you're better off hitting up someone else to sell your urns! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s not like that you guys! 
kun,It’s okay. Don’t worry! We’re here for you! 
kun,The first step to healing is admitting that you’ve been wronged!
Kazuya Kinoshita,I don’t need your counselling! I’m telling you that’s not it!
kun,"Open your eyes, fool! "
kun,There’s no other explanation for you getting ti hold hands with an S-ranked hottie!
kun,"Is she a runaway? Or wait, your long lost sister? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Knock it off!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-You’re being rude…
Kazuya Kinoshita,to my…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Girlfriend! 
Kun,Girlfriend? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hello, I’m Mizuhara."
Chizuru Ichinose,Kazuya-san and I have been dating for a bit. 
kun,“Girlfriend”?! 
Kun,"Does he mean that thing where you go on dates, eat pancakes, put up couple selfies on social media. "
Kun,And like each other’s posts?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What else is there?
Chizuru Ichinose,D-Dont push your luck.
Kun,Sire! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What the heck? This feels amazing! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Standing next to me is the GOAT cutie! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Like a raging, I’ve gone from last place to winning in life in one fell swoop! "
kun,Get over here!
kun,Did you do her? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? 
Kun,We’re asking if you’ve had sex! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Uh…not yet.
Kun,Good man! 
kun,"Lose your virginity to a babe like that, and you’ll never forget it! "
kun,Your sex life will be ruined forever! 
Kun,No other girl will satisfy you! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,These jerks…
kun,"Sorry about that! My name’s Kibe, ma’am "
Kun,And I’m Kuribayashi.
kun,"While you must be very busy on your date, we would love to invite you both to a drinking session. "
kun,Sasano-senpai called us out of nowhere. 
Kun,"You’ll come, right, Kazuya? "
kun,"As a dude, you’ll never get another chance like this. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Of course. We were just talking about getting some grub.
kun,There we go! 
Kun,"Come this way, ma’am."
Kun,You two take the elevator. 
kun,We’ll use the stairs. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sorry! 
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you playing at?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,How many lies must you tell before you’re satisfied?!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Also, we’ve gone way past an hour! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’ll pay for an extension, okay? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’ve known that guy since we were kids! He’s friendly with my gran, too!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"If he finds out about the rental girlfriend thing, so will she! "
Chizuru Ichinose,What? I can’t have that! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Even my grandma will find out, then! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Please! I’ll tell him soon enough that we broke up, anyway! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Help me make him a believer for now!
Kun,"Oh, they’re here. "
kun,"Come this way, you two. "
kun,"Sorry, we’re late! I brought Kazuya!"
kun,"What’s more, he’s with his girlfriend! "
kun,Uh…What’s with this mood? 
chan,Kazu-kun.
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mami-chan? 
kun,"My bad, Kazuya. I had no idea she’s be here. "
chan,"H-Heya, Kazuya. Come on in. "
kun,I’ll start with a draft. 
kun,And for the lady? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ll have a Shirley Temple.
Kun,"So, like, I had no idea, but then my ex…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I wanna go home, like, yesterday! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What is this hell situation?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Could the mood be any worse?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Kill me! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Just kill me now! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Should I pretend to hit the john and run away? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nope. I can’t leave Mizuhara all by herself here. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Is Mami-chan mad? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But, hey, she dumped me. I’ve done nothing wrong here, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Maybe she’s a teensy bit jealous? 
chan,C-C’mon guys. Why are we being so awkward? 
chan,"I’ve moved one, too, so it’s all in the past. Let’s enjoy our drinks."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Moved on? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Moved on, to what? A dog? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Like hell, She means a boyfriend. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Duh. Mami-chan’s a hottie. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hear me out, Mami-chan."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara’s just a rental girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m paying for her. Laughable, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"If I don’t agree with the terms of service, she won’t even come anywhere near me. "
chan,"Right, Kazu-kun?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-yeah… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,So Mami-chan’s been getting on just fine. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-You fool! Now isn't the time to rise up! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re gonna stay homeless for a while yet. 
chan,"Oh. Welcome back, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wh-What’s brought you two together? 
chan,"Oh, I just found her incredibly pretty. "
chan,"But if you’re that cute, you must have a hard time dealing with Kazu-kun’s libido. "
chan,"Y’know, he doesn't have any experience. "
chan,He gets this scary look in his eyes sometimes. 
chan,I wore a miniskirt on a date once. 
chan,"And he was all like, “I can’t stand right now!” "
chan,"Once we kissed, he wanted it every date, even if lunch had been packed with garlic. "
chan,And the he’d try to hold my hand all the time.
chan,And take me to pubs that stay open late for dinner. 
chan,It was almost impressive just how horny he was. 
kun,"That’s enough, Mami-chan. "
chan,What? Why? 
chan,"I mean, aren’t I right, Kazu-kun? "
Chizuru Ichinose,I can’t take this. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t badmouth my Kazuya-san 
chan,Huh? Sorry. I wasn’t trying to… 
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s absurd that you’d tell a stranger about thins that happened when you dated. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I feel bad for him! 
chan,"Oh-Oh… Sorry, if I offended you. "
chan,But this is our usual group dynamic…
Chizuru Ichinose,You think that means you can say anything you want?! 
kun,"Okay, calm down, you two. "
chan,"Apologise to her for me, Kazu-Kun! "
Chizuru Ichinose,You should tell her off! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"That’s just how I am, okay? "
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m leaving. 
kun,"You sure about this, Kazu-chin? "
kun,Kazu-chin. 
kun,Listen to me. Just call her. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, buzz off. "
kun,Is he gonna be okay?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I know, okay? I know! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I know Mizuhara spoke up for me because I didn’t. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s fine this way. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Ultimately, she’s just a rental girlfriend. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,The most shallow of relationships. 
chan,My place is close by. Wanna stop by? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,B-But didn’t you say you have a boyfriend? 
chan,I made it up because brought along such a pretty girlfriend.
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mami-chan? 
chan,"Oh, sorry! "
chan,"My little brother has his friends over, so we can’t go to my place. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Gah, I wanna go! I wanna see her room! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"O-Oh, really? Are you and your brother close? "
chan,No way. He’s a total brat. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But wait, she was trying to invite me over, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ve totally got a shot! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I can take her home instead! 
chan,Kazu-kun?! 
chan,You okay? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, sorry. I guess I was drunker than I thought. "
chan,"Oh, I have water on me. "
chan,"Here, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Damn…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan smells so good! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And she’s being nicer to me now than she ever was when we were dating. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan…
Kazuya Kinoshita,The thought of other guys getting in your pants is sheer torture! 
chan,Do taxis even come down this way? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’ll never get a chance like this again. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Go for it, Kazuya!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mami-chan… Do you wanna come over to my place now, maybe? "
chan,Huh? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"W-Wait, I wasn’t implying anything by that! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Fish… Yeah, I wanna show you some new fish! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s not like I’m being a creep because I’m still not over you or anything! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But, you know, every time I see you at college, you’re just so cute. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"And your legs are so sexy, and I… "
chan,Kazu-kun… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I… 
chan,I get it. 
chan,"Sorry about that. There, there. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What’s wrong with me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m such trash. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I keep pining for something I won’t get back. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I even hurt Mizuhara over it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Then I jumped to conclusions, made a move. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Got rejected again, and now she’s patting my head…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,But I just can’t help it! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Deep down, I still want her approval! "
chan,"Anyway, that’s one funny girl you’re dating. "
chan,"Just when I thought she was being awfully quiet, she had that outburst. "
chan,Does she have a few screws loose? 
chan,I find it hard to deal with someone who blows their lid over every little thing. 
chan,"She’s a tough type to hang with, and honestly, a little cringey. "
chan,"Hey, there’s nothing wrong with going by looks. "
chan,"But you’re a big boy now, so you should consider personality, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s not like that. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara’s not the kind of girl you think she is. 
chan,"Wh-What’s the matter, Kazu-kun? "
chan,You’re scaring me a little. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry. I…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I still like you, to be honest. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,It doesn’t even bother me when you diss me in public. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m just happy you're still talking to me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I mean, I seriously wanted to be the one to make you happy… forever. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,But…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hearing you badmouth Mizuhara doesn't sit right with me. 
chan,"H-Hey, I wasn’t really… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,S-Sorry! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why did I do that? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sure she hates me now. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But right now, I just want to see Mizuhara… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And apologise to her! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Isn’t she home yet? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Or is she mad at me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, duh. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I kept pushing her to do things she didn’t want to, and then embarrassed her to boot. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why would she ever want to see my face again? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, uh…"
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m not mad or anything. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Like I keep saying, I’m a rental girlfriend. "
Chizuru Ichinose,How you choose to deal with me is up to you. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Of course your ex would be more important. 
Chizuru Ichinose,So? Did you manage to get back with her? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I didn’t. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hell, I even went and got on her bad side. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m such scum, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Getting all pathetic over something that’s in the past… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I even dragged you into it and hurt you.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I'm so sorry, Mizuhara. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I really don’t know what’s wrong with me. 
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s not pathetic. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Not being able to let go shows how much you care. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Much better than a relationship you can easily forget. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Do you want to try continuing wit the rentals? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Some nights, you may want to die if you don’t have company, and some goodbyes can only be healed by a “See you again.” "
Chizuru Ichinose,"If you want, I can give you both. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara! 
kun,"What’s up, man? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, uh, I’m just wondering if I should really even be here. "
kun,Yeah… Same group as last time and all.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mami-chan probably doesn't want me around, though. "
kun,"You’d be surprised, actually. "
chan,"We probably shouldn't invite Kazuya, huh? "
chan,What? Why? 
chan,Kazu-kun and his girlfriend should come along! 
chan,It’s the beach! It’ll be hype! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Is she not mad at me? 
chan,"Don’t worry about it, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What an angel! 
kun,"So, Kazu-chin, you couldn’t get Chizuru-chan to come? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Huh? U-Uh, well, this happened on such short notice, you know."
kun,"You better have made up with her, man. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Of course! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Extension fee, right. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Of course she’d be nice to a customer, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I can’t keep this up forever. 
kun,"Well, it’s between the two of you. "
kun,"I know just how hard you feel for Mami-chan, but still, you should really treat your current girlfriend right. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,He doesn't know anything. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Of course I’d want to treat her right… if she were really my girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why did she go out her way to say that? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan… in a swimsuit? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What does she think about me and Mizuhara? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Does inviting us mean she doesn’t mind us? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I need to find out how she really feels. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Even if I tell her I broke up with Mizuhara. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sure gran will accept it if I have Mami-chan with me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I need to get with Mami-chan on this trip. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll leave my aimless rental life here in Izu! 
chan,Nope. 
chan,"Oh, man! I’m starting to get excited! "
chan,"I mean, we’re at the beach! Let’s enjoy this! "
Chizuru Ichinose,Oh… coming!
chan,Kazu-kun.
chan,Well? Enjoying yourself? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y-Yeah, I’m loving it! "
chan,Summer in the first year of college only come once. 
chan,Not enjoying it would be an insult to life itself. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wait I’ll regret it forever if I don’t look. 
chan,"Do you want some, too? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Huh? Yeah, sure. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I would've liked to get two more angles. 
chan,"Oh, right. "
chan,Sorry about the other day. 
chan,"We may have been drinking, but I shouldn’t have said all that. "
chan,That was insensitive of me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? I shouldn’t have said what I did- 
chan,Nah.
chan,Your girlfriend was absolutely right. 
chan,I was being awful.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I didn’t know she was worrying about it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,She really is a nice girl. 
chan,"We only went out for a month, but I made so many memories! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Really? 
chan,"We went to and amusement park, to Skytree, and to Tokyo Dome. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeah. 
chan,"We even kissed in the heat of a moment, just the once. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Her lips were so soft… 
chan,Do you remember? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,H-Huh? 
chan,We even picked a name of our future kid. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"M-Maya, right? "
chan,"Yeah, Maya! "
chan,We took a syllable each from both of our names. 
chan,And decided to use it whether we had a boy or a girl. 
chan,And when I asked you how many kids you’d like. 
chan,You said you wanted enough to fill up a soccer team. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"H-Hey, the more the m-m-merrier, right? "
chan,"Yeah, but my body has to keep up! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Keep up? Keep up with what!? 
chan,I’m sure that would’ve been fun. 
chan,"But your girlfriend is a nice girl, and you two seem very in love. "
chan,"Maya can never be born now, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s not what you think. Mizuhara’s a rental girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m paying her to be with me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,She and I have no future together. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I want to be with you…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hey! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"The truth is, Chizuru and I are really…"
kun,What’s up? Do you know her? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What’s Mizuhara doing here?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, “Mizuhara”?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"No, that’s Ichinose! "
Kun,I know the other two from literature. Kwanaka-san and… Ichihara san? 
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s Ichinose.
Kun,Oh sorry! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nobody’s realised that Ichinose is Mizuhara? 
kun,"Wait, don’t Kazuya and Ichinose-san know each other? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"What? Oh, uh…"
Chizuru Ichinose,"It’s our first time speaking, isn’t it, Kazuya-san? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,N-Nice to meet you. 
kun,I don’t believe it! 
kun,"I mean, are you really… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,B-Busted?! 
kun,Wearing glasses at the beach?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,His brain’s what’s busted! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Let’s go, Yoko. "
san,"Yeah, okay."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Thank goodness. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She must have been freaking out, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara Chizuru’s got nerves of steel. 
chan,"Kazu-kun, Kazu-kun. "
chan,What were you about to say? 
chan,You two are really… what? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"O-Oh, that wasn’t… "
chan,I wanna know. 
chan,Tell me. 
chan,Tell me the truth about you and your girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"W-Well, the thing is…"
kun,"Kazuya, we’re playing to see who goes shopping. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,C-Coming. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I suck so much.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I need to tell Mami-chan the truth if I want to know how she really feels. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But if I tell them about the rental girlfriend thing… 
kun,"I’m so sorry I let this happen, Nagomi-san!"
chan,"Y-Yeah, well, you are a virgin. "
chan,And virgins gonna virgin. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I wouldn't be able to live after that! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, sorry, I forgot to lock the door. "
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you playing at? Didn't you agree to stay away from me?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why are you in Shimoda? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Right back at you! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"My friends wanted to hit the beach, and I was forced to tag along. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"So, what do you want? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Um… 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m not lending you any money. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What do you think I am? That’s not it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Then what? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why did you say what you did last time? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I didn’t mean anything by it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"You seemed to be down in the dumps, so I told you it was okay to rent a girlfriend to heal after getting dumped, is all."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh…
Kazuya Kinoshita,So she was only saying that as a rental girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But she’s definitely still a nice girl. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"That’s a relief, then."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, uh, I’m getting pretty cozy with Mami-chan right now. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I might actually have a chance. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Really? Good for you. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"You were just a rental girlfriend, so I did think it’d be weird to say this… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But, hey, we’re Wednesday partners and all, and you’ve been so nice to me. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I was a little worried you might take offence if I got back with Mami-chan. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Man, I really can’t thank you enough…"
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s get one thing straight! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Me and you are rental girlfriend and client! 
Chizuru Ichinose,I have zero interest in you! 
Chizuru Ichinose,I was just being nice to you out of pity! Does your brain misinterpret everything?!
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t come talking to me about crap like that! Have you no self-preservation instincts?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Talking to you fries my brain…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, that’s going too far. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I was trying to express my thanks. 
chan,Kazu-kun? Are you in there? 
Chizuru Ichinose,You go! What other choice do we have?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"H-Hey, what brings you here? "
chan,I’d thought I’d help you with the shopping. 
chan,Is someone’s inside? I heard voices…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Nah, nobody! I-I was on the phone! "
chan,Liar. You left your phone back on the table. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I don’t have it! 
chan,"Sheesh, boys are such lousy liars. "
chan,"Especially you, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m done! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"If she sees Ichinose in there, she’ll realise she and Mizuhara are the same person! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"We meet again. It’s me, Mizuhara Chizuru. "
chan,Th-The girlfriend? 
kun,Chizuru-san?! 
Kun,Venus! 
kun,Y-You were here? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Y-Yes. 
kun,Why are you barefoot? Where are your shoes? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I left them at the beach. 
kun,"Ah, so you can be forgetful at times? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, why’d  you guys even come here? "
kun,We got extra orders! 
kun,C’mon Kazuya! You should've told me you invited her! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, I did. "
kun,Huh? But wasn’t she supposed to be busy with something? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,V-Visiting family!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She’s from Shimoda, you see. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,A-And she got some free time.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"So I was like, wanna meet up?"
kun,Really? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Y-Yes, something like that. "
kun,"Kazuya, what were you and her doing in the restroom? "
Kun,Were you doing her? Is that it?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"U-Uh, no, nothing…"
kun,Are you insane? 
kun,"I told you your sex life would be ruined if you lost your virginity to her, didn’t I?! "
Kun,No sex until she’s confirmed your partner for life! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why are you two so obsessed with this?! 
kun,"Listen, just don’t do it! "
kun,Don’t do her! 
kun,So scary… 
chan,I’m glad you’re here. I’ve been wanting to apologise about last time. 
chan,I’m sorry. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Oh, I’m sorry about what I said, too. "
chan,Oh shoot! I need to make a phone call! 
kun,Sure. 
Random guy,"Wow, you're cute. "
Random guy,S-Sorry! Never mind! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m leaving. Think up some excuse. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? Already? 
Chizuru Ichinose,We can’t risk it anymore. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re the one who showed up as Mizuhara. 
Chizuru Ichinose,What choice did I have? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Besides, we could’ve avoided this if you’d just told them we’d broken up already! "
chan,"What, sneaking off to talk? "
chan,You two are so lovey-dovey. 
chan,"Come on, let’s go."
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh? Uh…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sh-She was a sheltered rich girl, and she’s still a little frail because of it! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,She doesn't know much about hangout spots and stuff. 
kun,Is that so? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Y-Yes… Cough. 
kun,You are really fair skinned… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I-I randomly hit on her in Shibuya! 
Chizuru Ichinose,I-I guess…
Kazuya Kinoshita,No way. My nerves can’t handle this. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m gonna go wash off all this sand. 
Chizuru Ichinose,He’s running away?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Well yeah…
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s a top-ranked beauty in anybody’s eyes. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Way out of my league. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And I made here pretend to be my girlfriend again. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Paying here might not get me off the hook this time. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Forgive, Mizuhara. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Once this trip’s ever, I’ll tell them. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll tell Gran and these guys we broke up. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I bet Mami-chan’s totally disgusted with me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Who calls their girlfriend to a trip with friends? 
chan,Kazu-kun! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan? 
chan,I lost my bracelet. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? That sucks! 
chan,Yeah! It was really expensive! 
chan,It should still be around here.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-Yeah…
chan,Whoa. 
chan,"Awfully clumsy today, eh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, wai- "
Chizuru Ichinose,"I-I am, sorry. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Well, I trust Kazuya-san. "
chan,"Act normally when we're with the other, okay? "
chan,"Hey, I found my bracelet!"
Chizuru Ichinose,"Oh, I'm just feeling kind of warm. "
chan,"Your turn, Kibe-chan."
kun,All right! What are my options here?
chan,"Forgive me, Kazu-kun. "
chan,I couldn't control myself anymore.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Like hell I could forget that!
Kazuya Kinoshita,She couldn’t control herself? So she kissed me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Doesn't that mean she likes me?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"It looked like it was all over when Mizuhara showed up, but what if it only fanned Mami-chan’s flames even more? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is it!
Kazuya Kinoshita,She want me back! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Kazuya-san! 
chan,Let’s pick up where we left off. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Not even in death shall we part.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry, gotta take this. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Ugh, I might really be coming down with a cold. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hello? 
Grandma Nagomi,Gah! My ships all sank!
Grandma Nagomi,"Hard mode is such hell! I spent 30,000 yen on the gacha, too!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, that’s too bad. Later. "
Grandma Nagomi,"Whoa, hold up, Kazuya. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What is it? 
Grandma Nagomi,I’m going to be discharged next week. 
Grandma Nagomi,All the tests are finally done\. 
Grandma Nagomi,Now I can come see Chizuru whenever I want. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,That’s great! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Bye, Gah…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,O-Okay…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Discharged, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m glad it wasn’t anything major.
Kazuya Kinoshita,But… I’ve been deceiving Grandma all this time. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh? I-I couldn't say…
Chizuru Ichinose,"I-It’s pretty far away, though. "
Chizuru Ichinose,U-Uh…
Chizuru Ichinose,I-I don’t know…
kun,Cut it out. You’re putting her on the spot. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,W-Well…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry I’ve been lying to you, Gran! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,But I’ll introduce you to my real girlfriend soon! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,This fake relationship with Mizuhara ends now. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Thanks for everything, Mizuhara. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Th-The thing is…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Chizuru and I were actually talking about breaking up. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,So that’s kind of an awkward question to answer. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I-I know it’s not a great time to bring this up, but you know. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Right, Chizuru?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Th-That’s right. 
Kun,"W-Wait, why?! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,W-We just kinda got the blues after a while. You know how it goes.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Th-This is for the best.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I said I’d leave my aimless rental girlfriend life here in Izu! 
chan,Kazu-kun! 
kun,"Kazu-chin, you ain’t supposed to let your dick dictate your love life. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What makes you think you can just sock me like that?! 
kun,"Now you’ve done it, jerk! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Your balding ass is the one that started it! 
kun,"My hairline’s just a little shy, is all!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, that’s called balding! "
kun,"Oh, it’s on, you total nitwit! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Say what?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"O-Ow… Wait, s-sorry! "
chan ,"Don’t hurt him, Kibe-chan! "
kun,"I’m so disappointed in you, Kazu-chin! "
kun,When did you become such a self-centred dirt bag?! 
kun,"Don't think I haven’t noticed you fawning over Mami-chan! Blues, my ass! "
kun,I bet Chizuru-san just dumped you because you’re being so wishy-washy! 
kun,"Yes, your brain’s a dumpster fire, but at least make it burn for your current flame! "
kun,"If you can’t treat the girl who chose to be with you right, you’re a lost cause! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What would…
Kazuya Kinoshita,What would you know? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You don't know shit! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"You have no idea how much I liked Mami-chan, or how hurt I was when she dumped me! "
Kun,Chizuru-san’s right there! 
kun,"You’re no better, Mami-chan. "
kun,You know Kazu-chin’s a fool. 
kun,He jumps to conclusions. 
kun,Could you stop leading on a guy you dumped? 
chan,I wan’t trying to. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Kibe, you jerk! "
chan,Kazuya! 
chan,"Chizuru-san, you should probably leave for the day "
Chizuru Ichinose,I-I know. 
chan,Kazuya. 
chan,Restroom.
Chizuru Ichinose,You did well. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Chizuru Ichinose,You didn’t do anything wrong. 
Chizuru Ichinose,They don’t know the full story. Of course they don’t get it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Anyway, are you okay? Does it hurt?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,N-No.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll make a booking for next week. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,No actual date. Just tell the agency we went to eat sashimi in Shimoda or something. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And then we’re done. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gran’s getting discharged next week. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,She just called me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,We don't need to go visit her every Wednesday anymore.
Chizuru Ichinose,That’s good to hear. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeah. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"My grandma’s discharged next week, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Really? 
Chizuru Ichinose,So it’s the perfect time to end this. 
Chizuru Ichinose,It won’t take people long to forget that we were ever a thing. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"That was a pathetic display I put on back there, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I feel bad about just how much trouble I’ve caused you. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, you came clean about the “breakup.” "
Chizuru Ichinose,That’s step one toward moving on. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"No matter what the others made of it, I saw it as a bold move. "
Chizuru Ichinose,I guess you can be a man if you try. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Goodbye then. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-Yeah.
Chizuru Ichinose,Can I keep these sandals as a gift? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sure. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Thanks, "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"It must’ve sucked for you, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Having to play the girlfriend of trash like me. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Sheesh. Pull yourself together. 
Chizuru Ichinose,This is my job. 
Chizuru Ichinose,It was fun. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"I had fun, really. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wow. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re something else. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Dumbass. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Yikes.
Chizuru Ichinose,And all my stuff’s still in the restroom there…
kun,Chizuru-san. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Kibe-san? 
kun,Do you have time to chat? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She showed up at noon, so two hours? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Add to that the train fare to Shimoda…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Twenty-five thousand yen! That’s a lot! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,This always burns a hole in my wallet. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But given all I put her through even twice that wouldn't make up for it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Damn that Kibe…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Who punches a guy before getting the full story? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Just how undeserving does he think I am of Mizuhara?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I know, I know. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, I did show her off to him a lot.  "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"You reap what you sow, I guess. "
Kazuya Kinoshita ,"You’re so stupid, Kibe."
Kazuya Kinoshita,You should know there’s no way Mizuhara would go out with me for real. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You just don’t get it man. 
kun,Can I drop the formalities? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Y-Yes, go ahead. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? Kibe and Mizuhara?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What are they doing by themselves? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And things seem kinda awkward!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, is he asking her out? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, no. "
kun,Are you and Kazuya really breaking up? 
Chizuru Ichinose,W-We are. 
kun,"Oh,"
kun,I’ve known him since we were kids. 
kun,"I’ve watched him his entire life, including what a flop he is with the ladies. "
kun,"Well, I almost gave up on him when he got rejected three times in one month, though. "
kun,"By the same girl, no less. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why bring that up?!
kun,So I honestly couldn't believe my eyes when he showed up with a cutie like you.
kun,"He’s trash, isn’t he? "
kun,"He’s a wish-washy moron who always needs others to clean up his messes, but he still believes everything will work out for him."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hey! Tell him he’s wrong!
kun,"But sometimes, I think it’s a real talent to be so stupidly optimistic. "
kun,"Once, in grade school, our class was growing morning glories over the summer. "
kun,But I knocked over his planter by accident. 
kun,I couldn't tell where the seeds had flown off to. 
kun,I just grabbed the dirt laying around and put it back. 
kun,"Amazingly, his sprouted first. "
kun,"It was clearly just a weed, but he was adamant that it was a morning glory. "
kun,"The teacher tried to stop him, but he showed up first every morning to water it. "
kun,And he even kept a journal for it. 
kun,"What a moron, right?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Absolutely. 
kun,"I felt bad about the whole thing, and decided to apologise to him once summer break ended. "
kun,But then… 
kun,What do you think happened? 
kun,The plant blossomed. 
kun,Into a flower prettier than anyone else’s.
kun,It was a rare flower called “Hibiscus t-something-num.”
kun,It won him the gold medal in our research project. 
kun,"He was sad because it wasn't a morning glory, but I was mad jealous of that flower. "
kun,It never would've bloomed if he’d given up and stopped watering the plant. 
kun,Reality’s always out to grind us down. 
kun,"The rent’s through the roof, the neighbourhood strays always poop by your front door, the manga you love goes out with a whimper, and stuff. "
kun,But you know what? 
kun,"When you let reality win and stop dreaming, you die inside. "
kun,"When you stoop up for Kazu-chin at the pub, I thought he’d finally found someone who noticed his positives."
kun,I don't know what happened between the two of you…
kun,"But if you’ve just grown sick of him being a dumbass, could you give him another chance? "
kun,"If her ever pisses you off, I’ll beat him up for you. "
kun,"He’s not a bad guy, honestly. "
kun,"In the end, I know he’ll make sure you don’t regret it. "
kun,"Oh, here. I bought these at the convenience store. "
kun,I figured you two needed some alone time.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Oh, I couldn’t possibly accept them!"
kun,Don't worry about it. Let me do this for you. 
kun,"My best bud landed the best girl, but I’d done nothing to congratulate you two."
kun,Kazuya?
Chizuru Ichinose,He’s running?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, I’m sorry…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sorry I hit earlier! 
kun,"Shut it, you dolt. "
kun,"Well, I’ll leave you two to it."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, wai- "
Kazuya Kinoshita,A-Awkward!
Chizuru Ichinose,This one’s yours. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Right…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mizuhara, uh… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll go. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I can’t say no after that speech he gave. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"If it’s just us on the ferry, we won’t have to worry about putting on an act. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,A-Are you sure? What about your friends? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ve been gone two hours now. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"At this point, all I can do is call them and say I left because I felt sick."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh… Sorry again.
Chizuru Ichinose,But this really is the last time. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Kibe-san doesn't know our situation, so he’ll accept it if you tell him we talked it out and decided to break up. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y-Yeah, you're right. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"It’s the last time. After this, we’re done. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-You okay? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Are you actually sick? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m fine. It’ll go away after a night’s rest. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m more than happy doing this to hep get your story straight. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I don't want this whole thing hanging over future jobs. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry… I didn’t expect it to turn into such a big deal. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Like I said, you did nothing wrong."
Chizuru Ichinose,"You can’t get over your ex, right? "
Chizuru Ichinose,Then go get her back will all you’ve got. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"If there’s something you want, you have to go all out to claim it for yourself. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Life’s more fun that way. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Anyway, I’ll be inside. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Thank you, Mizuhara. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’ve given me courage. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Once I get off this ferry, "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m gonna ask Mami-chan out! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll clean up the rest of this mess myself. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll talk to everyone and make sure they get it.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry you had to do all this for us. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why does the review scale only go up to five? I’d give you ten stars if I could! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, and I won’t talk to you at college. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’ll try to avoid you while taking out the trash and stuff, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And I won’t rent you anymore. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I won’t rent Mizuhara Chizuru out anymore. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Your phone’s ringing. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"O-Oh, it is. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Sorry, could you leave me alone? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,O-Okay. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hello? 
chan,Kazu-kun? You free to talk? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, for a bit. "
chan,"Wow, it’s so loud there. What are you doing? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I… I’m just outdoors. 
chan,I want to talk. Can we meet now? 
chan,Kazu-kun?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"N-Not right now, but in a bit, sure."
chan,How long do you need? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Ten minutes? Fifteen, maybe? "
chan,Got it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wh-Where are you? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,The hotel lobby? Just outside? 
chan,The pool.
chan,The hotel’s swimming pool.
chan,I’m waiting all by myself. 
chan,And I’ll wait till you get here. 
chan,"Are you listening, Kazu-kun? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y-Yeah, I am. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What floor is that?
Kazuya Kinoshita,Fourth floor? Got it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara Chizuru is just a rental girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"A fake one who won’t last, and one you’re not allowed to really fall for."
Kazuya Kinoshita,But… But I…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Where am I?
Chizuru Ichinose,"Oh, right. I fell off the ferry…"
Chizuru Ichinose,He jumped in to save me? 
Chizuru Ichinose,This keeps getting worse!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Not only can I not take care of myself, I even put my client in danger! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, are you okay? "
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, wake up! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"You’re kidding, right?! Come on! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Quit playing around! Wake up, come on! "
Chizuru Ichinose,S-Someone help! 
Chizuru Ichinose,What was it… Pump the chest thirty times? 
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you playing at?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"I told you, how you deal with me is up to you! "
Chizuru Ichinose,Why put yourself at risk like this when I’m not even your real girlfriend? 
Chizuru Ichinose,How stupid are you?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"I keep telling you, I’m just a rental girlfriend! "
chan,Mami! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Crap… I’m fading. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Did I die? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I thought I could do it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I guess real life isn't as easy as movies or manga. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry, Gran. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I never got to introduce you to a nice girl. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry, Mizuhara. I couldn’t even clean up my own mess."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Man, seriously…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Talk about pathetic. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? Did you just…
Chizuru Ichinose,Sorry! 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m sorry you had to jump in to save me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Uh, n-no…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Likewise. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"After that, the Coast guard guys gave us a royal chewing-out. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Then our friends snapped on us. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Ultimately, I skipped out on meeting Mami-chan. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And had to spend the night in a nearby hospital.
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mizuhara! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, uh… Thanks! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"For, you know… doing all that to save me. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Why wouldn't I? I’m your girlfriend. 
kun,What’s going on here? 
kun,"You call off the breakup? She just said “girlfriend,” present tense. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Nah, it’s not that. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mizuhara’s a rental girlfriend, and real mature."
Kazuya Kinoshita,She wouldn't think anything of a mere kiss. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m fine… I’m perfectly fine.
kun,"Hey, there’s the big hero. "
Kun,"Oh, yeah! Give me an autograph! "
chan,Hilarious! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Aren’t you guys even a little worried about me? 
kun,"Wait, where’s Chizuru-san? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Huh? Oh, she said she was going back home. "
kun,That’s too bad. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Thanks for coming to pick me up. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"M-Mami-chan, about yesterday…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Of course she hates me now. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry, Gran! It’s back to the drawing board! "
kun,"Quit standing around and get in, Kazuya! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,O-Okay.
chan,"Well, later. "
chan,Don’t drown in the bathtub. 
chan,Come save me if I do.
kun,See ya. Give my regards to Chizuru-san. 
kun,"I won’t tell Nagomi-san about the stupid ""blues” thing."
kun,Just stay with her. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"What? No, we’re still breaking up. "
kun,You’re still going on about that? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is way more complicated than you think. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Ow! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Why’d you hit me again, jerk?! "
kun,"Life ain’t easy as you think, but it ain’t as hard as people make it out to be. "
kun,You put your life on the line for her. 
kun,"If that’s not love, then what the hell is? "
kun,Don’t let her go. Your entire lifetime supply of semen depends on it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Not happening. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara feels nothing for me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nothing at all…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Seriously, no! Not Mizuhara of all people!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Don’t forget her cold stare when she demands you fork over the money! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Her face might be smiling but her eyes aren’t! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Could you go be gross somewhere else? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mizuhara! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Move.
Kazuya Kinoshita,S-Sure.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I-I already made the booking for next week. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,No actual date. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll put the money in your post box. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"So, uh… Once again…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sorry and stuff. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I see. Thanks. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,That was just CPR to keep her client alive. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Part of her job. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Only a fool would fall for a girl like that for real. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Reminiscing already? We just got back. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeesh. Can’t you even lay low for two.
chan,"No, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Whoa… This is gonna be a big one. 
chan,"Sheesh, stop it! "
chan,"No, don’t! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hell no! 
chan,"You’re such a bad boy, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan…
chan,"Come on, Kazu-kun. "
chan, Hey! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan…
chan,You know you can’t do that.
chan,Kazu-kun! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,If I told her this was how it all began Mizuhara would be pissed. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But that was definitely the moment I realised… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,N-No… I can’t be…
Kazuya Kinoshita,That these feelings had passed the point of no return. 
chan,Chizuru…
chan,"You do know that urban legend about summer break, right? "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Again, I’m sorry. My tummy started really badly…"
chan,"Oh, we met at the beach. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Okay, let’s get going! "
chan,Huh? What’s gotten into you? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s just go! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What’s going on? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ve never reacted her like that… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"No, stop it! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara’s just a rental girlfriend! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,That’s it! Nothing more!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Man, am I really… "
Grandma Nagomi,"Hey, keep your eyes on the road. "
s Father,"Yeah, yeah, I know. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why are we going into the mountains? 
Grandma Nagomi,"Health tourism, my boy. "
Grandma Nagomi,I snagged a booking for a hot springs resort known for helping your organs recover. 
s Mother,I hear they serve pheasant for dinner. It’s Mt. Akagi’s local specialty! 
Grandma Nagomi,Pheasant?That takes me back! 
Grandma Nagomi,Haven’t had any since I got some from a customer at the bar…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, can’t complain if it’s for health. "
Grandma Nagomi,"We’re here! Nashihi-kan, Gunma’s hidden-away hot spring resort!"
Grandma Nagomi,We get welcome drinks for free! 
Grandma Nagomi,And we can get up to thirty ice creams from the lobby machine at no extra charge! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Thirty? I’d spend all day on the can! 
Grandma Nagomi,Is our friend not here yet? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? Friend? 
Grandma Nagomi,"Oh, there she is. Sayutaso! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,“Sayutaso”? 
Grandma Sayuri,"Oh, Nagomin! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara’s grandma?! 
s Mother,"Oh, Ichinose-san. Good to see you again."
s Father,Thank you for looking after my mother in the hospital.
Grandma Sayuri,"No, I should be the one thanking her. "
Grandma Nagomi,"Come on, say hello. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wh-Why’s Ichinose-san here? 
Grandma Sayuri,"She got all better and was discharged, too, so we decided to go on a trip together to celebrate. "
Grandma Sayuri,Thank you so much for inviting me.
s Mother,What are you doing? You’re acting strange. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"U-Uh, well, I’m just wondering if the person whose name starts with “Chi” is here too. "
Grandma Nagomi,“Chi”? None of our hospital buddies had a name like that.
Kazuya Kinoshita,O-Oh. 
Grandma Nagomi,You’re over there. 
Grandma Nagomi,"I could only get one room in the luxury Haseo-tei, so I got you one elsewhere "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? 
Grandma Nagomi,Do you want to force Ichinose-san into a regular room? 
Grandma Sayuri,"Sorry about this, Kazuya-kun. "
Grandma Nagomi,Here’s your key. 
Grandma Nagomi,"Let’s sleep together, Sayutaso! "
Grandma Sayuri,"Sure, Nagomin! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gotcha. Never mind me. Just enjoy your discharge trip. 
Grandma Nagomi,"Wow, I have such an understanding grandson. "
Grandma Nagomi,There he goes.
Grandma Sayuri,"There he goes, indeed. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why’s it unlocked? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nobody’s here.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? Did the previous guest leave those? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Clean it up, staff! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, I guess I can chill out more by myself. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I feel bad ‘cause our grandmas seem to be having fun, seem to having fun, but I have to tell them during this trip that broke up. For Mizuhara’s sake, too. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, Grandma! "
Chizuru Ichinose,Can you help me do my hair? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Wh-What are you doing here?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mizuhara?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"H-Hey, wait up! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Where are you going, Mizuhara? "
Chizuru Ichinose,How haven’t you realised? We’ve been set up! 
Chizuru Ichinose,The Grandma Axis is conspiring to get the grandkids to form an alliance! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,“Conspiring”? That’s a bit overblown. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"I don’t mind them getting along, but they're meddling too much in affairs. "
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m giving them a piece of my mind! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,R-Right. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Stop right there. Take the stairs. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, right, closed elevator and all.\"
Grandma Nagomi,"Sorry about that, Chizuru-san. "
Grandma Sayuri,"It’s okay, Chizuru. You have fun with Kazuya-kun. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t give me that! I was waiting for you in the room! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sh-She’s right, Gran. This is too much. "
Grandma Nagomi,"Look, we had them arrange for Fukata and personalised dinners for us. "
Grandma Nagomi,Changing rooms now would inconvenience the hotel staff. 
Grandma Sayuri,"What’s the problem, Chizuru? You two are dating. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Sure, but sharing a room is too much. "
Chizuru Ichinose,We haven't crossed that line yet. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,“That” line?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara! 
Grandma Nagomi,What? You haven’t done it yet? 
Grandma Nagomi,We just assumed you guys had. 
Grandma Sayuri,You two are so reversed. 
Grandma Nagomi,"Well, no time like the present. "
Grandma Sayuri,Go all in! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Don’t give me that! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t give me that! 
Grandma Sayuri,"Run along to your room now, you two. "
Chizuru Ichinose,W-Wait a second! 
Chizuru Ichinose,What now? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Telling them we broke up now would just ruin the trip. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"We could ask for another room, I guess…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,But I’m broke. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Don’t go there. I’m low this month, too."
Kazuya Kinoshita,When you're that expensive? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Something to say? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,No…
Chizuru Ichinose,"God, this sucks. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Sharing a hotel room with a client is a disaster. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,All that aside…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yukata Mizuhara is out of this world! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,There’s no way I’d last an entire night with her in the same room. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Forget it. I’m just going to enjoy this. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? 
Chizuru Ichinose,My grandmom paid a small fortune for this. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Can’t let it go to waste! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Such resilience! 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m hitting the bath.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wait…
Chizuru Ichinose,"I know it’s awkward, but this can’t keep going on."
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m gonna tell them we broke up. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Got that? 
Grandma Nagomi,This gacha’s rates suck! 
Grandma Nagomi,Chizuru? 
Grandma Nagomi,Am I living the lucky lever trope now?!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Our relationship was a lie. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was all a lie I told. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,My feelings don’t factor into it.
Grandma Nagomi,"Ah, I see. So that trope only counts when it’s the opposite sex? "
Chizuru Ichinose,Y-Yes.
Grandma Nagomi,You learn something new every day. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Um. Mrs. Kinoshita, I shouldn’t be making you do this. "
Grandma Nagomi,Don’t sweat it. 
Grandma Nagomi,’Tis an honour to be washing my future granddaughter-in-law’s sultry back. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Oh, please. What’s sexy about a back? "
Grandma Nagomi,Says the girl with this spunky bottom. 
Grandma Nagomi,And these bountiful breasts. 
Grandma Nagomi,You’re truly a ray of hope that shines upon us Kinoshitas.
Grandma Nagomi,I’ll take great care to wash you inside and out. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Wait…
Grandma Nagomi,After all the father’s genes won’t be worth squat. 
Grandma Nagomi,I apologise for my grandson.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Uh, you don’t have to. "
Grandma Nagomi,"This is also a remembrance trip, you see."
Grandma Nagomi,Today’s the date my husband passed. 
Chizuru Ichinose,What? Then…
Grandma Nagomi,"Oh, don’t worry about me. I’m over it now. "
Grandma Nagomi,"That said, it was always a day that made me feel a little lonely, but I got out of the hospital, made a new friend, and even got to take a bath with you. "
Grandma Nagomi,It has become a special day for me now.
Chizuru Ichinose,Can I ask you something? What would do if I were lying? 
Chizuru Ichinose,What if I weren't the kind of person you think I am? 
Grandma Nagomi,Nobody goes through life without lying.
Grandma Nagomi,I’d love you even if you were an alien. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ve given up on trying to figure out this mess! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Gotta get our money’s worth! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Here, cheers."
 Chizuru Ichinose,Ch-Cheers. 
Chizuru Ichinose,So yummy! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Uh, isn’t that the sauce? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I thought it was soup! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I drank quite a bit…
Chizuru Ichinose,You’re such a dolt. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ve never seen her laugh like a normal girl before. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I guess I really am a bother to her. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, night. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I can sleep in the bathroom or by the door. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I know you won’t have pleasant dreams with me around. 
Chizuru Ichinose,What’s the big deal? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Why can’t you just sleep here? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"What are you saying, Kazuya-san? You’ve been calling me all day."
Chizuru Ichinose,Of course I would go anywhere for your grandmother!
Grandma Nagomi,My angel!
Grandma Nagomi,I believed in you!
Grandma Nagomi,I knew you wouldn't cast Kazuya aside!
Grandma Nagomi,"A boy like him will never get another girlfriend, after all!"
Grandma Nagomi,You’d better come see me on Wednesday.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I do, every week."
Grandma Nagomi,Not by yourself. Bring Chizuru along.
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re not happy just to see me?
Grandma Nagomi,Absolutely not.
Grandma Nagomi,"Also, make sure to walk her back."
Kazuya Kinoshita,You don’t have to tell me.
Grandma Nagomi,Rest assured. I guarantee that you two will get married someday.
Sumi Sakurasawa,Um, excuse me. Are you Kazuya-san's girlfriend?
Chizuru Ichinose,No, I'm just his rental girlfriend.
Sumi Sakurasawa,Oh, I see. Well, I hope you're taking good care of him.
Ruka Sarashina,Hi, Kazuya-kun! I've been looking for you everywhere!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh, hey Ruka. What's up?
Ruka Sarashina,Not much. I just wanted to talk to you about something important.
Chizuru Ichinose,Who's this?
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is Ruka. She's a friend from school.
Ruka Sarashina,Nice to meet you! I'm Kazuya-kun's girlfriend.
Chizuru Ichinose,What?!
Chizuru Ichinose,An orange shirt and striped pants…
Chizuru Ichinose,"You must be Kazuya-Kun, right?"
Chizuru Ichinose,You’re in college? What year?
Kazuya Kinoshita,F-First year.
Chizuru Ichinose,"What? Me, too!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, but I took a gap year."
Chizuru Ichinose,"Ah, you are older than me then."
Chizuru Ichinose,Oops.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Damn…
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s hot!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Anyone dating her would be living the life!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Whoa.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, uh…"
Chizuru Ichinose,Do you mind?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, sure. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Crap… I wanna leave.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I wanna go home and sleep.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, so we’re following the date plan I sent by text."
Chizuru Ichinose,This is my first time at an aquarium.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Really? That’s unusual.
Chizuru Ichinose,Look that fish is cute.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh that’s the lowlight tetra. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Do you know a lot about fish?
Kazuya Kinoshita,I-I guess? I love hitting up aquariums.
Chizuru Ichinose,Wow!
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m so glad my first aquarium visit was with you!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Well, I had lots of fun today."
Chizuru Ichinose,"Thanks, Kazuya-kun! See you! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,O-Outrageous!
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was all an act!?
Kazuya Kinoshita,Holding hand before the end is just part of her routine?!
Kazuya Kinoshita,How dare she toy with my heart?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I just need to give her a piece of my mind! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Kazuya-Kun, did you wait long?"
Chizuru Ichinose,I was worried you might not like this hairdo.
Chizuru Ichinose,What do you think?
Kazuya Kinoshita,I-I don’t hate it or anything.
Chizuru Ichinose,Thank goodness!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Damn it! She’s so cute!
Chizuru Ichinose,Fee received. Thank you.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, doesn’t it make you feel empty inside?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y’know, going on dates with guys you don’t even like."
Kazuya Kinoshita,And getting paid for it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Doesn’t it get to you? 
Chizuru Ichinose,No. I love my job. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"I get to meet people like you, after all."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? W-We’re not ma- 
Chizuru Ichinose,We’re dating.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"No, we’re not even that."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"We're total strangers, aren't we? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Technically.
Cashier,"Oh, uh… I guess I’ll split your purchases up."
Chizuru Ichinose,"Sure. We can be whatever you wants us to be, Kazuya-kun."
Chizuru Ichinose,"Look, Kazuya- kun! Neon tetras! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, yeah."
Chizuru Ichinose,Cute! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Garden eels hide in the sand because they’re afraid, right?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wow… she must have read up on them.
Kazuya Kinoshita,She did her homework… all for today’s date.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Enough already.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Seriously, what is that gonna achieve?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Is that just your professionalism? It’s meaningless! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Not like these relationships last more than a day!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, what’s gotten into you, Kazuya-kun?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,You must break up immediately!
Kazuya Kinoshita,It doesn’t matter how much you care for your partner!
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s get out of here. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I know that was stupid…
Kazuya Kinoshita,But I got it off of my chest…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why do all these girls get into fake relationships with people they don’t even like?!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Okay, look…"
Chizuru Ichinose,What is wrong with you? Are you stupid?!
Chizuru Ichinose,Yelling like that in a public place… Way to get everyone’s eyes on us.
Chizuru Ichinose,"What’s your problem, anyway?"
Chizuru Ichinose,"All day you’ve been like, “Don’t you feel empty inside?” And “We’re total strangers!”"
Chizuru Ichinose,Seriously are you stupid? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,U-Uh…
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m your rental girlfriend. This is just how it works! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Weren’t you the one who made the request?!
Chizuru Ichinose,"You saw the user agreement and clicked “I agree”, didn’t you?!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I did… I’m sorry.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Also, why did you give me a one-star review?! "
Chizuru Ichinose,Did I do anything wrong on our date?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"That brought my rating down a whole 0.3 points, you know!"
Chizuru Ichinose,I’d only ever gotten five-star reviews before that.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Here we go.
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is the real Mizuhara Chizuru.
Chizuru Ichinose,"I’ve always given this job my all, including this date. "
Chizuru Ichinose,I don’t even like fish but I went and bought a book about them for this date.
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s a completely different person than before.
Kazuya Kinoshita,All I can say for sure is…
Chizuru Ichinose,Could you not get in the way of my work?
Chizuru Ichinose,I can’t believe you!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Ugh, this sucks! Guess I’m getting another one-star review!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m totally in the wrong.
Chizuru Ichinose,"So, what now?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Do you want to continue?
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ll tag along if you want to keep going.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hello? What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Hey! We’re not done talking here! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? Seriously? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Got it! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,My grandma collapsed…
Chizuru Ichinose ,Huh?
Kazuya Kinoshita,I gotta go! 
Chizuru Ichinose,H-Hey! 
Chizuru Ichinose,You still have time left! 
Grandma Nagomi,It’s not such a big deal. I only fainted.
s Mother,"But of course we would worry, Mother! Your health is important! "
s Father,"Mom, you need to realise that you aren’t young anymore."
s Father,We do have a shop to run! 
s Father,And this isn’t the first time you’ve been hospitalised.
Grandma Nagomi,Does this room have WI-FI? 
s Mother,The phone is probably a bad idea.
s Father,I’ll get you some magazines for senior citizens! 
s Mother,Would you like something soft to eat?
Grandma Nagomi,Don’t act like I’m on my last legs! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Anyway, who might that young lady be?"
s Mother,I brought her in because she was with Kazuya.
s Mother,Are you his classmate from college?
Chizuru Ichinose,E-Er…
s Mother,"You couldn’t be his girlfriend, right?"
s Father,"No way, honey. This is Kazuya we’re talking about. "
s Mother,Right. It’s Kazuya. 
Grandma Nagomi,Kazuya? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,G-Girlfriend…
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s my girlfriend! 
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s a pleasure to meet you.
Chizuru Ichinose,My name is Mizuhara Chizuru. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Perfect.
Chizuru Ichinose,"It’s a shame I had to introduce myself under such circumstances, but I’m glad to meet you all nonetheless. "
Grandma Nagomi,Get me discharged! 
s Father,What?!
Grandma Nagomi,We need to get home and prepare for a party!
s Father,"Don’t be absurd, Mom! "
Grandma Nagomi,Listen to yourself!
Grandma Nagomi,Kazuya”s brought home a real hale and hearty hottie!
Chizuru Ichinose,H-Hale and hearty hottie?! 
Grandma Nagomi,Can you believe it? Our Kazuya…
s Father,Mom!
Grandma Nagomi,He has such as beautiful girlfriend! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Grandma Nagomi,"Our Kazuya, of all people! "
Grandma Nagomi,After showing no signs of anything resembling a love life for twenty whole years. 
Grandma Nagomi,Kazuya… Our Kazuya has…
s Father,"We’re heading back to the store. Watch over her, Kazuya."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sure.
s Father,"And make sure you walk your girlfriend back, okay? "
s Mother,"Chizuru-san, come visit our home sometime."
Chizuru Ichinose,Thank you.
Grandma Nagomi,"By the way, you two…"
Grandma Nagomi,Have you had sex already?
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gran! 
Grandma Nagomi,Physical compatibility matters a lot in a marriage.
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Marriage? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Kazuya-san and I have talked about it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,We both want to take the things seriously. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"He’s your family’s eldest son, so we wanted to hold off until we had your approval. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Her ad libbing is on point! 
Grandma Nagomi,Do it! You have my permission! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Day or night, whenever! As much as you want! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gran! 
Chizuru Ichinose,If you say so…
Chizuru Ichinose,I guess we could. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is an act! It’s all an act!
Grandma Nagomi,Oh right! Let me go get the other old girls!
Chizuru Ichinose,Others? 
Grandma Nagomi,They asked me to introduce my grandson’s girlfriend if he ever got one! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, what’s going on here?"
Grandma Nagomi,"Oh, this is the third time she’s been hospitalised here. It seems she’s made quite a few friends here. "
Chizuru Ichinose,What do I do? This is bad!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why are you panicking? 
Chizuru Ichinose,She’s here…
Chizuru Ichinose,My grandma’s an in patient at this hospital too.
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I haven’t told her anything about the rental girlfriend job.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Isn’t that really bad news?
Chizuru Ichinose,That’s exactly what I said!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Anyway, I need to get out of here! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hey… 
Grandma Nagomi,"Follow me, everyone. "
Grandma Nagomi,"She’s a real babe, I tell you !"
Grandma Nagomi,I’ve never seen a girl that hot! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Crap! They're here! 
Chizuru Ichinose,This way! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Try not to collapse in shock, Tanaka-san."
san,I’ll be just fine!
san,"The rest of you watch out for heart attacks, too! "
Grandma Nagomi,Huh? They’re gone.
Kazuya Kinoshita,A vacant room? 
Grandma Nagomi,They were here just a minute ago! 
Grandma Nagomi,It’s true! Believe me! 
Chizuru Ichinose,it’s only a matter of time before they find us here. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wanna exit through the window?
Chizuru Ichinose,We’re on the fifth floor you know. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What do we do then? 
Chizuru Ichinose,We’ll have to leave one at a time. 
Chizuru Ichinose,You go first and distract them. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ll use that chance to get outside. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Distract them? How? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Figure that out yourself! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Th-They’re coming!
Chizuru Ichinose,Get over here! 
Grandma Nagomi,Not here either? 
Grandma Nagomi,"Where art thou, Chizuru? "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Keep it down, stupid! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is…
Kazuya Kinoshita,The biggest crisis of all! 
Chizuru Ichinose,What in the world is wrong with you?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nothing! It’s not my fault! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s a natural response for any twenty year old guy! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Get it back down right now! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I can’t, okay? I just can’t! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"If you keep it up, I’ll report you to the agency. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Don’t move! You’re making its worse! 
Grandma Nagomi,Uh.. are you all right? 
Chizuru Ichinose ,"I am fine, thanks! "
Grandma Nagomi,That’s good. 
Grandma Nagomi,"If I may ask, have you seen a young couple around? "
Grandma Nagomi,Really? Thank you! 
Grandma Nagomi,The targets are outside! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Looks like she’s gone.
Chizuru Ichinose,Yeah…
Kazuya Kinoshita,This range is l-lethal…
Kazuya Kinoshita,What a slender…
Kazuya Kinoshita,And soft… body!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, right now…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She’s my girlfriend, isn’t she? "
Chizuru Ichinose,Like hell!
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you thinking? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t forget that I’m just a rental girlfriend!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hell could freeze over, and I still would be yours for real! "
Grandma Sayuri,"Chizuru? Is that you, Chizuru?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Grandma…
Grandma Nagomi,"What’s the matter, Ichinose-san?"
Grandma Nagomi,Kazuya!
Grandma Sayuri,What's this Kazuya-Kun? 
Grandma Sayuri,You mean your grandson’s girlfriend is Chizuru? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Are you serious?!
Grandma Sayuri,Chizuru is my granddaughter.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I shouldn't make this worse for her! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry, Gran! I don’t really have a girl- "
Chizuru Ichinose,What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Kazuya- san’s grandmother and mine are friends? 
Chizuru Ichinose,What a coincidence! Like it was written in the stars!
Chizuru Ichinose,Or something…
Grandma Nagomi,I don’t believe it.
Grandma Nagomi,"To think Chizuru was your granddaughter, Ichinose-san! "
Grandma Sayuri,"I don’t believe it, either."
Grandma Nagomi,But it all makes sense now.
Grandma Nagomi,Of course your granddaughter would be a bombshell in every possible way!
Grandma Sayuri,"Oh, please."
Grandma Sayuri,"I can also rest easy if Chizuru is dating your grandson, Kinoshita-san."
Grandma Nagomi,Here’s hoping we go from friends to family when they get married. 
Grandma Sayuri,Likewise. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Say no to collusion! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry… I made you lie for me.
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s fine.
Chizuru Ichinose,Lots of clients want to introduce me to their family. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Really?
Chizuru Ichinose,"Anyway, it’s partly my fault for keeping this job a secret. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s just tell them we broke up.
Chizuru Ichinose,That’s the best option.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeah. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,My family runs a store called “Nagomi Sake.” 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was started in my granddad’s time and now my mum and dad run it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Even after my granddad died early.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"My grandma keeps it running, despite having debts and my dad to worry about. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"So, to our family, my grandma’s like a goddess. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And it’s our goddess’s wish that I find someone nice before she dies. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m a real grandma’s boy, so I want ti grant her wish before she goes."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I had a girlfriend for a month, recently."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"When I asked her to meet my grandma, she refused. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And ultimately she dumped me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was out of desperation that I pressed that button and rented you.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Lame as hell, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"What am I, a rabbit?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,One that dies if it gets lonely.
Chizuru Ichinose,There’s no one alive who doesn't get lonely. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Just a lot of people good at hiding it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,They all fill the void in their heart with work or significant others. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll apologise to my grandma… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And introduce a real girlfriend to her someday. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll figure it out myself. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"After all, there’s no way to get your true self on rental. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Ow!
Kazuya Kinoshita,What was that for?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,That was corny as hell! Gross! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Could you please not drag me into your embarrassingly self-absorbed soliloquy? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y-You’re one to talk, with the corny act you put one every day! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, I do it for work. Corny is perfectly fine by me."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, uh… Sorry about everything today."
Kazuya Kinoshita,And thanks.
Chizuru Ichinose,"I’m no different. I want to make my family happy, too."
Chizuru Ichinose,"But, I just can’t quit this job right now. "
Chizuru Ichinose,I don’t want anything like today’s date ever again.
Chizuru Ichinose,But whenever you find yourself feeling like a rabbit. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Feel free to call me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nah. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I doubt I’ll see Mizuhara Chizuru ever again. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I won’t turn to her anymore. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m done with pretend dating forever. 
Chizuru Ichinose,That dork. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And this is where my real story begins.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"The story of my precious, yet optimistic campus life."
kun,"Yo, Kazuchin. "
kun,How many times did you jerk it yesterday? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,The story of my rueful virgin life starts now! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Three times! 
kun,"Whoa, hardcore! "
Kun,Virgins gonna virgin! 
kun,"What’s up, Kazuya? You know her? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? No…
kun,"Who is that, even? "
Kun,I think it’s Ichi… Ichi-something… from the literature department.
kun,So what's the story? Felt like something was up between you two. 
Kun,"Yeah, tell us."
Kazuya Kinoshita,No… I think I mistook her for someone else.
kun,What?!
kun,The heck? Don’t get our hope up like that.
Kun,Any girl you see makes you think you’ve “met her before”? 
Kun,Virgins gonna virgin.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Speak for yourself!
kun,We’ll be in touch later.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sure. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s way too crazy to be true.
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s probably just someone else.
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t you dare tell anyone!
Chizuru Ichinose,You don’t know me at all!
Chizuru Ichinose,And there was nothing between us!
Chizuru Ichinose,Promise me that!
Kazuya Kinoshita,So you really are Mizuhara?
Chizuru Ichinose,"Yes, I am. I’m keeping my job a secret. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Problem with that?
Chizuru Ichinose,I do it because I don’t want people talking behind my back!
Chizuru Ichinose,Repeat after me! You and I are… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Okay, okay! I get it!"
Chizuru Ichinose,Sheesh. Why are you even here?
Chizuru Ichinose,"I’ve been avoiding dates in the same area as the college, but this makes it all meaningless. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Goodbye. I pray that you never hit the “I agree” and “confirm” buttons again.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I can’t believe Mizuhara Chizuru goes to my college…
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh?!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, hang on! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mizuhara-san? It’s you, isn’t it?! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Or wait, Ichinose-san? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Talk about coincidence, huh?"
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you doing here?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, my apartment is next door."
Chizuru Ichinose,"I mean, why do you live here? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Uh, I’m not sure how to answer that."
Chizuru Ichinose,No interacting with me! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"No meddling or prying, either! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,The heck? Don’t act like I’m some kind of stalker.
Kazuya Kinoshita,But…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She’s living in my apartment complex… Right next door, even."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mizuhara Chizuru, of all people."
Grandma Nagomi,"Hey, Kazuya. I finally got through to you."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, you got internet in your hospital room?"
Grandma Nagomi,It’s 980 yen per month for WIFI.
Grandma Nagomi,An unexpected expense!
Kazuya Kinoshita,I need to tell her the truth. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, Gran…"
Grandma Nagomi,"I’m about to head over to your place, Kazuya."
Grandma Nagomi,Can you call Chizuru over for me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? No way! 
Grandma Nagomi,Didn't you know?
Grandma Nagomi,There’s this popular new mobile game called Hot ’n Steamy Hot Springs Matron.
Grandma Nagomi,And this “Sen” girl in it is a dead ringer for Chizuru.
Grandma Nagomi,I ended up whaling for her.
Grandma Nagomi,"See you in a bit, then! I can’t wait! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wait a- 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? Gran’s coming over now? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You need to book a rental girlfriend a week in advance. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s too late now!
Kazuya Kinoshita,But she’ll snap if I tell her in person that we broke up1 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What if she cries on me again? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Help me! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Be my girlfriend one more time! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh? Are you kidding me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Please! Gran’s coming over today! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Just an hour… No, even half an hour will do! "
Chizuru Ichinose,Didn't we agree to tell our grandmas we broke up?
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m not ready for that conversation yet.
Chizuru Ichinose,Why should I care?!
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s taken a real liking to you!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She looked so lively talking about you, I couldn't bring myself to tell her!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Please! I beg of you! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Not happening. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Article 3 (c) of the user agreement: Demanding that our talents accompany the user toothier residence, workplace, or other private space is strictly forbidden.” "
Chizuru Ichinose,"You’re old enough to know what that means, right? "
Chizuru Ichinose,"if you're going to lie, you need to make it right. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Putting things off turns people into children. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"And above all, I decided I’m going to finish my report today. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Goodbye! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Hey, Kazuya. Put on some tea. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,You got here quick! 
Grandma Nagomi,Gotta strike while the iron’s hot. 
Grandma Nagomi,Look at how filthy this apartment is. 
Grandma Nagomi,No one would guess that the guy living here has a girlfriend. 
Grandma Nagomi,She’s sharp as ever.
Grandma Nagomi,When do you think Chizuru will arrive? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, uh, I don't know. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Um… let me try calling her. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hello? It’s me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gran’s already here. You busy?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, you're at work? Ah, I see. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Who is it? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Delivery for you.
Chizuru Ichinose,Hel… Huh?
Kazuya Kinoshita,Please! Just a minute… even ten seconds will do!
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m gonna call the cops! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll buy you sweets from the convenience store! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Get out!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m begging you. Think of it as helping me out! I mean, we’ve date before, right?!"
Chizuru Ichinose,"I was just a rental girlfriend, damn it!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, I have to brace myself and just do it."
Grandma Nagomi,"Hey, Gran…"
Grandma Nagomi,I need to tell you something. 
Grandma Nagomi,"You broke up, didn’t you? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,G-Gran?
Grandma Nagomi,She got tried of sloppiness and split. 
Grandma Nagomi,I can picture it clear as day. 
Grandma Nagomi,And you tried to cover it up because you couldn't bring yourself to tell the truth.
Grandma Nagomi,That is no way for the heir to the Kinoshita family to act. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Aren’t you mad?
Kazuya Kinoshita,At me… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,At Mizuhara? 
Grandma Nagomi,Never in your life have you been a ladies’ man. 
Grandma Nagomi,And I mean that literally! Not even once!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeah.
Grandma Nagomi,All you ever brought over were stinky boys.
Grandma Nagomi,There was a time when I doubted there was a single girl out there who’d come to like you. 
Grandma Nagomi,How could I ever be angry with the lady who did fall for you? 
Grandma Nagomi,She showed me a beautiful dream. 
Grandma Nagomi,Truly an angel sent by the heavens.
Kazuya Kinoshita ,Gran…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, I’m such an idiot. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,A girl like Mizuhara would never date me for real.
Kazuya Kinoshita,It was all an illusion. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s a rental girlfriend.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m sorry, Gran!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I…
Kazuya Kinoshita,I…
Chizuru Ichinose,I-I’m so sorry! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Here we go.
Chizuru Ichinose,I got help up cooking.
Kazuya Kinoshita,How.. Why are you here? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"What are you saying, Kazuya-san? You’ve been calling me all day. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Of course I would go anywhere for your grandmother! 
Grandma Nagomi,My angel! 
Grandma Nagomi,I believed in you! 
Grandma Nagomi,I knew you wouldn't cast Kazuya aside! 
Grandma Nagomi,"A boy like him will never get another girlfriend, after all! "
Grandma Nagomi,You’d better come see me on Wednesday. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I do, every week."
Grandma Nagomi,Not by yourself. Bring Chizuru along. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re not happy just to see me? 
Grandma Nagomi,Absolutely not. 
Grandma Nagomi,"Also, make sure to walk her back. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,You don’t have to tell me. 
Grandma Nagomi,Rest assured. I guarantee that you two will get married someday. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Here. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Never mind that. We’ve gone too far to tell the agency, anyway. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Not for that. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll rent you next week. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But you don't have to come. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"You couldn't get your report done after all this, right? "
Chizuru Ichinose,When do you list her? Wednesday? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Huh? Y-yeah, every Wednesday. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"No other days, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh right! 
Chizuru Ichinose,No meddling! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Make like a stranger at college, too, obviously. "
Chizuru Ichinose,No talking to me! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"if you need to contact me, do it through the site! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mizuhara?
Chizuru Ichinose,Just one hour. 
Chizuru Ichinose ,You can rent me out just for one hour every Wednesday. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m not doing it for you! It’s for your grandmother! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Thanks, Mizuhara! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,For just one hour every Wednesday…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Be my girlfriend!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan…
Kazuya Kinoshita," First period is brand management, huh? "
chan,"Hello, Kazu-kun! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mami-chan…
Kazuya Kinoshita,We haven't talked since we broke up. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Damn, she’s so cute when I see her up close! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Her eyes are so round, and her hair is so fluffy! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Ask her! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Ask her why she blocked you!
chan,"What’s wrong, Kazu-kun? "
chan,You’re spaced out. 
chan,You dropped your reference book.
chan,Here.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Th-Thanks.
chan,Later! 
kun,"That’s him, officer! "
kun,The guy ogling his ex’s thighs first thing in the morning! 
Kun,I get it. Mami chan is fine. 
kun,"She’s feminine as hell, and she’s a total looker."
kun,"To top it off, she seems kinda easy. "
kun,"And she’s sure to go the extra mile in bed, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re the one ogling her! 
kun,"Her, on the other hand? She’ll just lie there and do nothing."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Dude…
kun,"Anyway, let me give you a solid piece of advice as an old bud. "
kun,Forget about Mami-chan.
kun,She’s way out of your league.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Coming, Coming! "
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you doing? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Isn’t it time to head over to the hospital? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s pick somewhere else to meet up. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"If my agency finds out we’re meeting by our front doors, they’ll fire me."
Chizuru Ichinose,We won’t be socialising outside of dates. 
Chizuru Ichinose,But I’ll do my job as usual when I’m your “girlfriend”. 
Chizuru Ichinose,There’s no need to go easy on me in reviews. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gotcha. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Okay, do you mind? "
Chizuru Ichinose,"It’s better for both of us to get the formalities out of the way, yeah? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, yeah. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Thank you very much.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Shall we get going, Kazuya-kun? "
Grandma Nagomi,"Chizuru, my angel! "
Grandma Nagomi,Stop by again! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Can we hold hands? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"What? O-Oh, sure. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s just part of her routine! 
kun,Kazuya? 
kun,What’re you doing here? 
kun,"Oh, right! The hospital Nagomi- san’s in is around here! "
kun,"Wait, who is that? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Crap! They’ll realise it’s Ichinose!
kun,"Sorry! He’s a sheltered idiot, but please don’t sign him up to your cult!"
Kun,"H-He has no money, so you're better off hitting up someone else to sell your urns! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s not like that you guys! 
kun,It’s okay. Don’t worry! We’re here for you! 
kun,The first step to healing is admitting that you’ve been wronged!
Kazuya Kinoshita,I don’t need your counselling! I’m telling you that’s not it!
kun,"Open your eyes, fool! "
kun,There’s no other explanation for you getting ti hold hands with an S-ranked hottie!
kun,"Is she a runaway? Or wait, your long lost sister? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Knock it off!
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-You’re being rude…
Kazuya Kinoshita,to my…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Girlfriend! 
Kun,Girlfriend? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hello, I’m Mizuhara."
Chizuru Ichinose,Kazuya-san and I have been dating for a bit. 
kun,“Girlfriend”?! 
Kun,"Does he mean that thing where you go on dates, eat pancakes, put up couple selfies on social media. "
Kun,And like each other’s posts?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What else is there?
Chizuru Ichinose,D-Dont push your luck.
Kun,Sire! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What the heck? This feels amazing! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Standing next to me is the GOAT cutie! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Like a raging, I’ve gone from last place to winning in life in one fell swoop! "
kun,Get over here!
kun,Did you do her? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? 
Kun,We’re asking if you’ve had sex! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Uh…not yet.
Kun,Good man! 
kun,"Lose your virginity to a babe like that, and you’ll never forget it! "
kun,Your sex life will be ruined forever! 
Kun,No other girl will satisfy you! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,These jerks…
kun,"Sorry about that! My name’s Kibe, ma’am "
Kun,And I’m Kuribayashi.
kun,"While you must be very busy on your date, we would love to invite you both to a drinking session. "
kun,Sasano-senpai called us out of nowhere. 
Kun,"You’ll come, right, Kazuya? "
kun,"As a dude, you’ll never get another chance like this. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Of course. We were just talking about getting some grub.
kun,There we go! 
Kun,"Come this way, ma’am."
Kun,You two take the elevator. 
kun,We’ll use the stairs. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sorry! 
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you playing at?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,How many lies must you tell before you’re satisfied?!
Chizuru Ichinose,"Also, we’ve gone way past an hour! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’ll pay for an extension, okay? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’ve known that guy since we were kids! He’s friendly with my gran, too!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"If he finds out about the rental girlfriend thing, so will she! "
Chizuru Ichinose,What? I can’t have that! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Even my grandma will find out, then! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Please! I’ll tell him soon enough that we broke up, anyway! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Help me make him a believer for now!
Kun,"Oh, they’re here. "
kun,"Come this way, you two. "
kun,"Sorry, we’re late! I brought Kazuya!"
kun,"What’s more, he’s with his girlfriend! "
kun,Uh…What’s with this mood? 
chan,Kazu-kun.
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mami-chan? 
kun,"My bad, Kazuya. I had no idea she’s be here. "
chan,"H-Heya, Kazuya. Come on in. "
kun,I’ll start with a draft. 
kun,And for the lady? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ll have a Shirley Temple.
Kun,"So, like, I had no idea, but then my ex…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I wanna go home, like, yesterday! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What is this hell situation?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Could the mood be any worse?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Kill me! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Just kill me now! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Should I pretend to hit the john and run away? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nope. I can’t leave Mizuhara all by herself here. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Is Mami-chan mad? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But, hey, she dumped me. I’ve done nothing wrong here, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Maybe she’s a teensy bit jealous? 
chan,C-C’mon guys. Why are we being so awkward? 
chan,"I’ve moved one, too, so it’s all in the past. Let’s enjoy our drinks."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Moved on? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Moved on, to what? A dog? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Like hell, She means a boyfriend. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Duh. Mami-chan’s a hottie. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hear me out, Mami-chan."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara’s just a rental girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m paying for her. Laughable, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"If I don’t agree with the terms of service, she won’t even come anywhere near me. "
chan,"Right, Kazu-kun?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-yeah… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,So Mami-chan’s been getting on just fine. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-You fool! Now isn't the time to rise up! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re gonna stay homeless for a while yet. 
chan,"Oh. Welcome back, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wh-What’s brought you two together? 
chan,"Oh, I just found her incredibly pretty. "
chan,"But if you’re that cute, you must have a hard time dealing with Kazu-kun’s libido. "
chan,"Y’know, he doesn't have any experience. "
chan,He gets this scary look in his eyes sometimes. 
chan,I wore a miniskirt on a date once. 
chan,"And he was all like, “I can’t stand right now!” "
chan,"Once we kissed, he wanted it every date, even if lunch had been packed with garlic. "
chan,And the he’d try to hold my hand all the time.
chan,And take me to pubs that stay open late for dinner. 
chan,It was almost impressive just how horny he was. 
kun,"That’s enough, Mami-chan. "
chan,What? Why? 
chan,"I mean, aren’t I right, Kazu-kun? "
Chizuru Ichinose,I can’t take this. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t badmouth my Kazuya-san 
chan,Huh? Sorry. I wasn’t trying to… 
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s absurd that you’d tell a stranger about thins that happened when you dated. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I feel bad for him! 
chan,"Oh-Oh… Sorry, if I offended you. "
chan,But this is our usual group dynamic…
Chizuru Ichinose,You think that means you can say anything you want?! 
kun,"Okay, calm down, you two. "
chan,"Apologise to her for me, Kazu-Kun! "
Chizuru Ichinose,You should tell her off! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"That’s just how I am, okay? "
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m leaving. 
kun,"You sure about this, Kazu-chin? "
kun,Kazu-chin. 
kun,Listen to me. Just call her. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, buzz off. "
kun,Is he gonna be okay?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I know, okay? I know! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I know Mizuhara spoke up for me because I didn’t. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s fine this way. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Ultimately, she’s just a rental girlfriend. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,The most shallow of relationships. 
chan,My place is close by. Wanna stop by? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,B-But didn’t you say you have a boyfriend? 
chan,I made it up because brought along such a pretty girlfriend.
Kazuya Kinoshita,M-Mami-chan? 
chan,"Oh, sorry! "
chan,"My little brother has his friends over, so we can’t go to my place. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Gah, I wanna go! I wanna see her room! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"O-Oh, really? Are you and your brother close? "
chan,No way. He’s a total brat. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But wait, she was trying to invite me over, right? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ve totally got a shot! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I can take her home instead! 
chan,Kazu-kun?! 
chan,You okay? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, sorry. I guess I was drunker than I thought. "
chan,"Oh, I have water on me. "
chan,"Here, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Damn…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan smells so good! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And she’s being nicer to me now than she ever was when we were dating. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan…
Kazuya Kinoshita,The thought of other guys getting in your pants is sheer torture! 
chan,Do taxis even come down this way? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’ll never get a chance like this again. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Go for it, Kazuya!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mami-chan… Do you wanna come over to my place now, maybe? "
chan,Huh? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"W-Wait, I wasn’t implying anything by that! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Fish… Yeah, I wanna show you some new fish! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s not like I’m being a creep because I’m still not over you or anything! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But, you know, every time I see you at college, you’re just so cute. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"And your legs are so sexy, and I… "
chan,Kazu-kun… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I… 
chan,I get it. 
chan,"Sorry about that. There, there. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What’s wrong with me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m such trash. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I keep pining for something I won’t get back. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I even hurt Mizuhara over it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Then I jumped to conclusions, made a move. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Got rejected again, and now she’s patting my head…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,But I just can’t help it! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Deep down, I still want her approval! "
chan,"Anyway, that’s one funny girl you’re dating. "
chan,"Just when I thought she was being awfully quiet, she had that outburst. "
chan,Does she have a few screws loose? 
chan,I find it hard to deal with someone who blows their lid over every little thing. 
chan,"She’s a tough type to hang with, and honestly, a little cringey. "
chan,"Hey, there’s nothing wrong with going by looks. "
chan,"But you’re a big boy now, so you should consider personality, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s not like that. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara’s not the kind of girl you think she is. 
chan,"Wh-What’s the matter, Kazu-kun? "
chan,You’re scaring me a little. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry. I…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I still like you, to be honest. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,It doesn’t even bother me when you diss me in public. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m just happy you're still talking to me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I mean, I seriously wanted to be the one to make you happy… forever. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,But…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hearing you badmouth Mizuhara doesn't sit right with me. 
chan,"H-Hey, I wasn’t really… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,S-Sorry! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why did I do that? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sure she hates me now. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But right now, I just want to see Mizuhara… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And apologise to her! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Isn’t she home yet? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Or is she mad at me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, duh. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I kept pushing her to do things she didn’t want to, and then embarrassed her to boot. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why would she ever want to see my face again? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, uh…"
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m not mad or anything. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Like I keep saying, I’m a rental girlfriend. "
Chizuru Ichinose,How you choose to deal with me is up to you. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Of course your ex would be more important. 
Chizuru Ichinose,So? Did you manage to get back with her? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I didn’t. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hell, I even went and got on her bad side. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’m such scum, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Getting all pathetic over something that’s in the past… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I even dragged you into it and hurt you.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I'm so sorry, Mizuhara. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I really don’t know what’s wrong with me. 
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s not pathetic. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Not being able to let go shows how much you care. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Much better than a relationship you can easily forget. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Do you want to try continuing wit the rentals? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Some nights, you may want to die if you don’t have company, and some goodbyes can only be healed by a “See you again.” "
Chizuru Ichinose,"If you want, I can give you both. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara! 
kun,"What’s up, man? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, uh, I’m just wondering if I should really even be here. "
kun,Yeah… Same group as last time and all.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mami-chan probably doesn't want me around, though. "
kun,"You’d be surprised, actually. "
chan,"We probably shouldn't invite Kazuya, huh? "
chan,What? Why? 
chan,Kazu-kun and his girlfriend should come along! 
chan,It’s the beach! It’ll be hype! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Is she not mad at me? 
chan,"Don’t worry about it, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What an angel! 
kun,"So, Kazu-chin, you couldn’t get Chizuru-chan to come? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Huh? U-Uh, well, this happened on such short notice, you know."
kun,"You better have made up with her, man. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Of course! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Extension fee, right. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Of course she’d be nice to a customer, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I can’t keep this up forever. 
kun,"Well, it’s between the two of you. "
kun,"I know just how hard you feel for Mami-chan, but still, you should really treat your current girlfriend right. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,He doesn't know anything. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Of course I’d want to treat her right… if she were really my girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why did she go out her way to say that? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan… in a swimsuit? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What does she think about me and Mizuhara? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Does inviting us mean she doesn’t mind us? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I need to find out how she really feels. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Even if I tell her I broke up with Mizuhara. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sure gran will accept it if I have Mami-chan with me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I need to get with Mami-chan on this trip. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll leave my aimless rental life here in Izu! 
chan,Nope. 
chan,"Oh, man! I’m starting to get excited! "
chan,"I mean, we’re at the beach! Let’s enjoy this! "
Chizuru Ichinose,Oh… coming!
chan,Kazu-kun.
chan,Well? Enjoying yourself? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y-Yeah, I’m loving it! "
chan,Summer in the first year of college only come once. 
chan,Not enjoying it would be an insult to life itself. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wait I’ll regret it forever if I don’t look. 
chan,"Do you want some, too? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Huh? Yeah, sure. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I would've liked to get two more angles. 
chan,"Oh, right. "
chan,Sorry about the other day. 
chan,"We may have been drinking, but I shouldn’t have said all that. "
chan,That was insensitive of me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? I shouldn’t have said what I did- 
chan,Nah.
chan,Your girlfriend was absolutely right. 
chan,I was being awful.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I didn’t know she was worrying about it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,She really is a nice girl. 
chan,"We only went out for a month, but I made so many memories! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Really? 
chan,"We went to and amusement park, to Skytree, and to Tokyo Dome. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeah. 
chan,"We even kissed in the heat of a moment, just the once. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Her lips were so soft… 
chan,Do you remember? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,H-Huh? 
chan,We even picked a name of our future kid. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"M-Maya, right? "
chan,"Yeah, Maya! "
chan,We took a syllable each from both of our names. 
chan,And decided to use it whether we had a boy or a girl. 
chan,And when I asked you how many kids you’d like. 
chan,You said you wanted enough to fill up a soccer team. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"H-Hey, the more the m-m-merrier, right? "
chan,"Yeah, but my body has to keep up! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Keep up? Keep up with what!? 
chan,I’m sure that would’ve been fun. 
chan,"But your girlfriend is a nice girl, and you two seem very in love. "
chan,"Maya can never be born now, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,It’s not what you think. Mizuhara’s a rental girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m paying her to be with me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,She and I have no future together. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I want to be with you…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hey! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"The truth is, Chizuru and I are really…"
kun,What’s up? Do you know her? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What’s Mizuhara doing here?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, “Mizuhara”?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"No, that’s Ichinose! "
Kun,I know the other two from literature. Kwanaka-san and… Ichihara san? 
Chizuru Ichinose,It’s Ichinose.
Kun,Oh sorry! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Nobody’s realised that Ichinose is Mizuhara? 
kun,"Wait, don’t Kazuya and Ichinose-san know each other? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"What? Oh, uh…"
Chizuru Ichinose,"It’s our first time speaking, isn’t it, Kazuya-san? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,N-Nice to meet you. 
kun,I don’t believe it! 
kun,"I mean, are you really… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,B-Busted?! 
kun,Wearing glasses at the beach?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,His brain’s what’s busted! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Let’s go, Yoko. "
san,"Yeah, okay."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Thank goodness. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She must have been freaking out, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara Chizuru’s got nerves of steel. 
chan,"Kazu-kun, Kazu-kun. "
chan,What were you about to say? 
chan,You two are really… what? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"O-Oh, that wasn’t… "
chan,I wanna know. 
chan,Tell me. 
chan,Tell me the truth about you and your girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"W-Well, the thing is…"
kun,"Kazuya, we’re playing to see who goes shopping. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,C-Coming. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I suck so much.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I need to tell Mami-chan the truth if I want to know how she really feels. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But if I tell them about the rental girlfriend thing… 
kun,"I’m so sorry I let this happen, Nagomi-san!"
chan,"Y-Yeah, well, you are a virgin. "
chan,And virgins gonna virgin. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I wouldn't be able to live after that! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, sorry, I forgot to lock the door. "
Chizuru Ichinose,What are you playing at? Didn't you agree to stay away from me?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why are you in Shimoda? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Right back at you! 
Chizuru Ichinose,"My friends wanted to hit the beach, and I was forced to tag along. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"So, what do you want? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Um… 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m not lending you any money. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What do you think I am? That’s not it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Then what? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why did you say what you did last time? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I didn’t mean anything by it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"You seemed to be down in the dumps, so I told you it was okay to rent a girlfriend to heal after getting dumped, is all."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh…
Kazuya Kinoshita,So she was only saying that as a rental girlfriend. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But she’s definitely still a nice girl. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"That’s a relief, then."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, uh, I’m getting pretty cozy with Mami-chan right now. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I might actually have a chance. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Really? Good for you. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"You were just a rental girlfriend, so I did think it’d be weird to say this… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"But, hey, we’re Wednesday partners and all, and you’ve been so nice to me. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I was a little worried you might take offence if I got back with Mami-chan. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Man, I really can’t thank you enough…"
Chizuru Ichinose,Let’s get one thing straight! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Me and you are rental girlfriend and client! 
Chizuru Ichinose,I have zero interest in you! 
Chizuru Ichinose,I was just being nice to you out of pity! Does your brain misinterpret everything?!
Chizuru Ichinose,Don’t come talking to me about crap like that! Have you no self-preservation instincts?! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Talking to you fries my brain…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, that’s going too far. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I was trying to express my thanks. 
chan,Kazu-kun? Are you in there? 
Chizuru Ichinose,You go! What other choice do we have?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"H-Hey, what brings you here? "
chan,I’d thought I’d help you with the shopping. 
chan,Is someone’s inside? I heard voices…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Nah, nobody! I-I was on the phone! "
chan,Liar. You left your phone back on the table. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I don’t have it! 
chan,"Sheesh, boys are such lousy liars. "
chan,"Especially you, Kazu-kun. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m done! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"If she sees Ichinose in there, she’ll realise she and Mizuhara are the same person! "
Chizuru Ichinose,"We meet again. It’s me, Mizuhara Chizuru. "
chan,Th-The girlfriend? 
kun,Chizuru-san?! 
Kun,Venus! 
kun,Y-You were here? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Y-Yes. 
kun,Why are you barefoot? Where are your shoes? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I left them at the beach. 
kun,"Ah, so you can be forgetful at times? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, why’d  you guys even come here? "
kun,We got extra orders! 
kun,C’mon Kazuya! You should've told me you invited her! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, I did. "
kun,Huh? But wasn’t she supposed to be busy with something? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,V-Visiting family!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She’s from Shimoda, you see. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,A-And she got some free time.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"So I was like, wanna meet up?"
kun,Really? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Y-Yes, something like that. "
kun,"Kazuya, what were you and her doing in the restroom? "
Kun,Were you doing her? Is that it?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"U-Uh, no, nothing…"
kun,Are you insane? 
kun,"I told you your sex life would be ruined if you lost your virginity to her, didn’t I?! "
Kun,No sex until she’s confirmed your partner for life! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why are you two so obsessed with this?! 
kun,"Listen, just don’t do it! "
kun,Don’t do her! 
kun,So scary… 
chan,I’m glad you’re here. I’ve been wanting to apologise about last time. 
chan,I’m sorry. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Oh, I’m sorry about what I said, too. "
chan,Oh shoot! I need to make a phone call! 
kun,Sure. 
Random guy,"Wow, you're cute. "
Random guy,S-Sorry! Never mind! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m leaving. Think up some excuse. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Huh? Already? 
Chizuru Ichinose,We can’t risk it anymore. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re the one who showed up as Mizuhara. 
Chizuru Ichinose,What choice did I have? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Besides, we could’ve avoided this if you’d just told them we’d broken up already! "
chan,"What, sneaking off to talk? "
chan,You two are so lovey-dovey. 
chan,"Come on, let’s go."
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh? Uh…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sh-She was a sheltered rich girl, and she’s still a little frail because of it! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,She doesn't know much about hangout spots and stuff. 
kun,Is that so? 
Chizuru Ichinose,Y-Yes… Cough. 
kun,You are really fair skinned… 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I-I randomly hit on her in Shibuya! 
Chizuru Ichinose,I-I guess…
Kazuya Kinoshita,No way. My nerves can’t handle this. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m gonna go wash off all this sand. 
Chizuru Ichinose,He’s running away?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Well yeah…
Kazuya Kinoshita,She’s a top-ranked beauty in anybody’s eyes. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Way out of my league. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And I made here pretend to be my girlfriend again. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Paying here might not get me off the hook this time. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Forgive, Mizuhara. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Once this trip’s ever, I’ll tell them. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll tell Gran and these guys we broke up. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I bet Mami-chan’s totally disgusted with me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Who calls their girlfriend to a trip with friends? 
chan,Kazu-kun! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan? 
chan,I lost my bracelet. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? That sucks! 
chan,Yeah! It was really expensive! 
chan,It should still be around here.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-Yeah…
chan,Whoa. 
chan,"Awfully clumsy today, eh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, wai- "
Chizuru Ichinose,"I-I am, sorry. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Well, I trust Kazuya-san. "
chan,"Act normally when we're with the other, okay? "
chan,"Hey, I found my bracelet!"
Chizuru Ichinose,"Oh, I'm just feeling kind of warm. "
chan,"Your turn, Kibe-chan."
kun,All right! What are my options here?
chan,"Forgive me, Kazu-kun. "
chan,I couldn't control myself anymore.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Like hell I could forget that!
Kazuya Kinoshita,She couldn’t control herself? So she kissed me? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Doesn't that mean she likes me?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"It looked like it was all over when Mizuhara showed up, but what if it only fanned Mami-chan’s flames even more? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,This is it!
Kazuya Kinoshita,She want me back! 
Chizuru Ichinose,Kazuya-san! 
chan,Let’s pick up where we left off. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Not even in death shall we part.
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry, gotta take this. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Ugh, I might really be coming down with a cold. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hello? 
Grandma Nagomi,Gah! My ships all sank!
Grandma Nagomi,"Hard mode is such hell! I spent 30,000 yen on the gacha, too!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, that’s too bad. Later. "
Grandma Nagomi,"Whoa, hold up, Kazuya. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What is it? 
Grandma Nagomi,I’m going to be discharged next week. 
Grandma Nagomi,All the tests are finally done\. 
Grandma Nagomi,Now I can come see Chizuru whenever I want. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,That’s great! 
Grandma Nagomi,"Bye, Gah…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,O-Okay…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Discharged, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m glad it wasn’t anything major.
Kazuya Kinoshita,But… I’ve been deceiving Grandma all this time. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Huh? I-I couldn't say…
Chizuru Ichinose,"I-It’s pretty far away, though. "
Chizuru Ichinose,U-Uh…
Chizuru Ichinose,I-I don’t know…
kun,Cut it out. You’re putting her on the spot. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,W-Well…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Sorry I’ve been lying to you, Gran! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,But I’ll introduce you to my real girlfriend soon! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,This fake relationship with Mizuhara ends now. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Thanks for everything, Mizuhara. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Th-The thing is…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Chizuru and I were actually talking about breaking up. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,So that’s kind of an awkward question to answer. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I-I know it’s not a great time to bring this up, but you know. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Right, Chizuru?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Th-That’s right. 
Kun,"W-Wait, why?! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,W-We just kinda got the blues after a while. You know how it goes.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Th-This is for the best.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I said I’d leave my aimless rental girlfriend life here in Izu! 
chan,Kazu-kun! 
kun,"Kazu-chin, you ain’t supposed to let your dick dictate your love life. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What makes you think you can just sock me like that?! 
kun,"Now you’ve done it, jerk! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Your balding ass is the one that started it! 
kun,"My hairline’s just a little shy, is all!"
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, that’s called balding! "
kun,"Oh, it’s on, you total nitwit! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Say what?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"O-Ow… Wait, s-sorry! "
chan ,"Don’t hurt him, Kibe-chan! "
kun,"I’m so disappointed in you, Kazu-chin! "
kun,When did you become such a self-centred dirt bag?! 
kun,"Don't think I haven’t noticed you fawning over Mami-chan! Blues, my ass! "
kun,I bet Chizuru-san just dumped you because you’re being so wishy-washy! 
kun,"Yes, your brain’s a dumpster fire, but at least make it burn for your current flame! "
kun,"If you can’t treat the girl who chose to be with you right, you’re a lost cause! "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What would…
Kazuya Kinoshita,What would you know? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You don't know shit! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"You have no idea how much I liked Mami-chan, or how hurt I was when she dumped me! "
Kun,Chizuru-san’s right there! 
kun,"You’re no better, Mami-chan. "
kun,You know Kazu-chin’s a fool. 
kun,He jumps to conclusions. 
kun,Could you stop leading on a guy you dumped? 
chan,I wan’t trying to. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Kibe, you jerk! "
chan,Kazuya! 
chan,"Chizuru-san, you should probably leave for the day "
Chizuru Ichinose,I-I know. 
chan,Kazuya. 
chan,Restroom.
Chizuru Ichinose,You did well. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Chizuru Ichinose,You didn’t do anything wrong. 
Chizuru Ichinose,They don’t know the full story. Of course they don’t get it. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Anyway, are you okay? Does it hurt?"
Kazuya Kinoshita,N-No.
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll make a booking for next week. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,No actual date. Just tell the agency we went to eat sashimi in Shimoda or something. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And then we’re done. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Gran’s getting discharged next week. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,She just called me. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,We don't need to go visit her every Wednesday anymore.
Chizuru Ichinose,That’s good to hear. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Yeah. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"My grandma’s discharged next week, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Really? 
Chizuru Ichinose,So it’s the perfect time to end this. 
Chizuru Ichinose,It won’t take people long to forget that we were ever a thing. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"That was a pathetic display I put on back there, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I feel bad about just how much trouble I’ve caused you. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Hey, you came clean about the “breakup.” "
Chizuru Ichinose,That’s step one toward moving on. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"No matter what the others made of it, I saw it as a bold move. "
Chizuru Ichinose,I guess you can be a man if you try. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Goodbye then. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-Yeah.
Chizuru Ichinose,Can I keep these sandals as a gift? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sure. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Thanks, "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"It must’ve sucked for you, huh? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Having to play the girlfriend of trash like me. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Sheesh. Pull yourself together. 
Chizuru Ichinose,This is my job. 
Chizuru Ichinose,It was fun. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"I had fun, really. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wow. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’re something else. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Dumbass. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Yikes.
Chizuru Ichinose,And all my stuff’s still in the restroom there…
kun,Chizuru-san. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Kibe-san? 
kun,Do you have time to chat? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"She showed up at noon, so two hours? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Add to that the train fare to Shimoda…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Twenty-five thousand yen! That’s a lot! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,This always burns a hole in my wallet. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,But given all I put her through even twice that wouldn't make up for it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Damn that Kibe…
Kazuya Kinoshita,Who punches a guy before getting the full story? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Just how undeserving does he think I am of Mizuhara?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I know, I know. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Well, I did show her off to him a lot.  "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"You reap what you sow, I guess. "
Kazuya Kinoshita ,"You’re so stupid, Kibe."
Kazuya Kinoshita,You should know there’s no way Mizuhara would go out with me for real. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,You just don’t get it man. 
kun,Can I drop the formalities? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Y-Yes, go ahead. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What? Kibe and Mizuhara?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,What are they doing by themselves? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,And things seem kinda awkward!
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Wait, is he asking her out? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, no. "
kun,Are you and Kazuya really breaking up? 
Chizuru Ichinose,W-We are. 
kun,"Oh,"
kun,I’ve known him since we were kids. 
kun,"I’ve watched him his entire life, including what a flop he is with the ladies. "
kun,"Well, I almost gave up on him when he got rejected three times in one month, though. "
kun,"By the same girl, no less. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why bring that up?!
kun,So I honestly couldn't believe my eyes when he showed up with a cutie like you.
kun,"He’s trash, isn’t he? "
kun,"He’s a wish-washy moron who always needs others to clean up his messes, but he still believes everything will work out for him."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hey! Tell him he’s wrong!
kun,"But sometimes, I think it’s a real talent to be so stupidly optimistic. "
kun,"Once, in grade school, our class was growing morning glories over the summer. "
kun,But I knocked over his planter by accident. 
kun,I couldn't tell where the seeds had flown off to. 
kun,I just grabbed the dirt laying around and put it back. 
kun,"Amazingly, his sprouted first. "
kun,"It was clearly just a weed, but he was adamant that it was a morning glory. "
kun,"The teacher tried to stop him, but he showed up first every morning to water it. "
kun,And he even kept a journal for it. 
kun,"What a moron, right?"
Chizuru Ichinose,Absolutely. 
kun,"I felt bad about the whole thing, and decided to apologise to him once summer break ended. "
kun,But then… 
kun,What do you think happened? 
kun,The plant blossomed. 
kun,Into a flower prettier than anyone else’s.
kun,It was a rare flower called “Hibiscus t-something-num.”
kun,It won him the gold medal in our research project. 
kun,"He was sad because it wasn't a morning glory, but I was mad jealous of that flower. "
kun,It never would've bloomed if he’d given up and stopped watering the plant. 
kun,Reality’s always out to grind us down. 
kun,"The rent’s through the roof, the neighbourhood strays always poop by your front door, the manga you love goes out with a whimper, and stuff. "
kun,But you know what? 
kun,"When you let reality win and stop dreaming, you die inside. "
kun,"When you stoop up for Kazu-chin at the pub, I thought he’d finally found someone who noticed his positives."
kun,I don't know what happened between the two of you…
kun,"But if you’ve just grown sick of him being a dumbass, could you give him another chance? "
kun,"If her ever pisses you off, I’ll beat him up for you. "
kun,"He’s not a bad guy, honestly. "
kun,"In the end, I know he’ll make sure you don’t regret it. "
kun,"Oh, here. I bought these at the convenience store. "
kun,I figured you two needed some alone time.
Chizuru Ichinose,"Oh, I couldn’t possibly accept them!"
kun,Don't worry about it. Let me do this for you. 
kun,"My best bud landed the best girl, but I’d done nothing to congratulate you two."
kun,Kazuya?
Chizuru Ichinose,He’s running?! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, I’m sorry…"
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m sorry I hit earlier! 
kun,"Shut it, you dolt. "
kun,"Well, I’ll leave you two to it."
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Hey, wai- "
Kazuya Kinoshita,A-Awkward!
Chizuru Ichinose,This one’s yours. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Right…
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Mizuhara, uh… "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll go. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I can’t say no after that speech he gave. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"If it’s just us on the ferry, we won’t have to worry about putting on an act. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,A-Are you sure? What about your friends? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’ve been gone two hours now. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"At this point, all I can do is call them and say I left because I felt sick."
Kazuya Kinoshita,Oh… Sorry again.
Chizuru Ichinose,But this really is the last time. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Kibe-san doesn't know our situation, so he’ll accept it if you tell him we talked it out and decided to break up. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y-Yeah, you're right. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"It’s the last time. After this, we’re done. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,Y-You okay? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Are you actually sick? 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m fine. It’ll go away after a night’s rest. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I’m more than happy doing this to hep get your story straight. 
Chizuru Ichinose,I don't want this whole thing hanging over future jobs. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry… I didn’t expect it to turn into such a big deal. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Like I said, you did nothing wrong."
Chizuru Ichinose,"You can’t get over your ex, right? "
Chizuru Ichinose,Then go get her back will all you’ve got. 
Chizuru Ichinose,"If there’s something you want, you have to go all out to claim it for yourself. "
Chizuru Ichinose,Life’s more fun that way. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mizuhara? 
Chizuru Ichinose,"Anyway, I’ll be inside. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Thank you, Mizuhara. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,You’ve given me courage. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Once I get off this ferry, "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’m gonna ask Mami-chan out! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll clean up the rest of this mess myself. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I’ll talk to everyone and make sure they get it.
Kazuya Kinoshita,Sorry you had to do all this for us. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Why does the review scale only go up to five? I’d give you ten stars if I could! 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Oh, and I won’t talk to you at college. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"I’ll try to avoid you while taking out the trash and stuff, too. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,And I won’t rent you anymore. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,I won’t rent Mizuhara Chizuru out anymore. 
Chizuru Ichinose,Your phone’s ringing. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"O-Oh, it is. "
Chizuru Ichinose,"Sorry, could you leave me alone? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,O-Okay. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Mami-chan? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Hello? 
chan,Kazu-kun? You free to talk? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Yeah, for a bit. "
chan,"Wow, it’s so loud there. What are you doing? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,I… I’m just outdoors. 
chan,I want to talk. Can we meet now? 
chan,Kazu-kun?
Kazuya Kinoshita,"N-Not right now, but in a bit, sure."
chan,How long do you need? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Ten minutes? Fifteen, maybe? "
chan,Got it. 
Kazuya Kinoshita,Wh-Where are you? 
Kazuya Kinoshita,The hotel lobby? Just outside? 
chan,The pool.
chan,The hotel’s swimming pool.
chan,I’m waiting all by myself. 
chan,And I’ll wait till you get here. 
chan,"Are you listening, Kazu-kun? "
Kazuya Kinoshita,"Y-Yeah, I am. "
Kazuya Kinoshita,What floor is that?
Kazuya Kinoshita,Fourth floor? Got it.
